                  The boundaries of Isabelle’s knowledge really showed today.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I came home annoyed enough for Isabelle to pick up on it, so
                  she asked if something was wrong. She didn’t seem to realize
                  the time, but I explained that I came home an hour late
                  because my train sat in the tunnel for a while after the
                  emergency brake activated.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Work is annoying enough when I have to do client work,” I
                  said, something of the sort, while crashing onto the couch.
                  “It’s just even more exhausting to stand neck-to-neck with
                  people forever before coming home.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Why do you go to your workplace if you don’t like the job you
                  do, then?” she asked.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Because it pays the bills.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Bills for what?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Do you actually not know?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She gave me an unsure look, as if I offended her. She couldn’t
                  know if she never had a reason to learn. Shame on me.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Sorry. I mean bills for everything. The apartment rent, the
                  food we eat, the lights, water, gas… The train isn’t free
                  either.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “So the money you get from your job is for all that?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Partly.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What’s the rest of it for?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I shrugged at her and chuckled, “Situations like with you, I
                  suppose. Not everyone can take in someone and feed, house, and
                  clothe them.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Because it’s expensive.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“It can be, yeah.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “But you’re helping me because that’s what good people do!”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I thought it over, then I responded, “I have to admit,
                  Isabelle: I’m helping you mostly because I’m curious about
                  you. I want to understand everything about you, including what
                  you’ll become.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What I’ll become?..”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I’ve no idea what your future is. I can’t even begin to
                  guess. And I have even less of an idea of what your past is.
                  Your life is such an anomaly that you’ve pulled me away from
                  something horrible just to understand you.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I assumed it would be best to be honest. She didn’t respond
                  immediately. She went to the restroom for a few moments then
                  returned, saying, “Does that mean you don’t actually care
                  about me, then?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“No, I do. In fact, I think you’re very special.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Special as what, though? As a person? Or just as an
                  interest?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t see why it can’t be both.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Then she asked the question I was worried she’d eventually
                  bring up.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Do you still see me as an Aiom?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I admit that I might come off as pretentious to most people,
                  or just sounding too confident in myself. At that moment, I
                  had completely lost my tongue. And that was amazing to me - I
                  could feel embarrassment from our conversation, for I was
                  afraid of upsetting her or saying the wrong thing, despite my
                  notions of her possibly being an Aiom.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I do,” I said slowly, “But you clearly prove me wrong, time
                  and time again. I don’t want to see you as an Aiom, but I
                  can’t help but have the notion when there is evidence against
                  you. Isn’t that reasonable?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Yeah. I think so.” She was quick to agree, making me wonder
                  if I misread her tone when she questioned me. She sat beside
                  me and asked, “I’m convincing you that I’m not an Aiom though,
                  right?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Yes.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “So help me keep convincing you! What do normal people do?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Is it not contradictory for you to say you are a person while
                  asking me what people do?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I don’t know. I’m just asking to learn. For example, does
                  everyone have to work a job that they don’t like?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “No, not everyone. Not everyone has to work at all, even.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Who pays their bills, then?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“The government.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What does that mean?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Nothing. Let’s not get into that.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>That’s too controversial for her.</span>
                <br />
