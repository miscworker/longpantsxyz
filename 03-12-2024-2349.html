                  With all the commotion that came with Isabelle, I forgot to
                  check for responses readers have been sending in. My apologies
                  for that.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Out of all of them, there is an interest message from a Mister
                  McCormick:
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I think you are bullshitting all of us with this Isabelle.
                  However, if you are telling the truth, I would love to
                  purchase her. Name your price.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  First off, it is not my goal to deceive anyone at all. If it
                  were, I wouldn’t make up a situation as hard to believe as
                  Isabelle. That may not seem like enough of a reason to
                  everyone, but I think that’s fair.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Secondly, Mister McCormick, you must be misunderstanding the
                  content I’ve shared here. Isabelle believes herself to be a
                  regular person like anyone else, even with all the evidence
                  against her. There’s no way she can be sold. Even if I was
                  alright with the ethics of it, I doubt she would go very
                  easily.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It does bring up the question as to how long she is going to
                  be around, though. If she is so much like a normal person, to
                  what extent of a normal life is she capable of living? I
                  cannot imagine her finding much success in a career, nor in a
                  search for her own place, especially around here. Her only
                  hope would be somewhere small and accepting of such an unusual
                  citizen willing to lend a hand in whatever work is out there.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The idea of Isabelle working in some corporate office is a
                  funny thought, I have to admit. It’s far from any realistic
                  fate of hers, though.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’m not going to propose anything like that to her for now.
                  It’s not as if she is bleeding me dry, although the price of
                  those weird outfits of hers were a lot more than I was
                  expecting, but living alone for years and working for one of
                  the biggest companies in the country does give the opportunity
                  to build up reliable savings.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It is also worth mentioning that, if Isabelle is to be a
                  person like anyone else, that I don’t own her as a possession
                  nor have any authority over her, except for the house rules at
                  least. That is more of a rule for myself than for her, though,
                  since I feel like I am the possessive type to worry too much.
                  If I didn’t have any self-control, I’d police her every
                  moment.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In fact, I would be a liar if I didn’t admit that the idea of
                  transforming her into a desirable person didn’t cross my mind.
                  A person that is not only free of Aiom AI but also the
                  temptation and need for constant consumption taught to all
                  Americans is a perfect candidate for raising a happy person. I
                  think. I’m not sure what the right term I want to use is.
                  Nobody can be perfect, but maybe someone can be naturally
                  happy? Or is it authentically?
