                  I managed to actually sleep for a few hours today, but not
                  before being awoken by Isabelle’s movement in the living
                  space.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Today was honestly normal, if I was a normal person anyway. I
                  don’t mean that in any pretentious way - if anything, I wish I
                  was more average. Rather, it was a weird day for myself in the
                  end by being more normal.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle came with a whole list of errands I had to take care
                  of: she needed new clothes, there was no food in the house,
                  she wanted to clean up the house but couldn’t because I didn’t
                  have any cleaning supplies. She didn't literally tell me to
                  provide her of all these things, but her complaints were
                  obvious. I told her I would get everything for her, though
                  there wasn’t any practical way for me to purchase clothes for
                  her alone without having her accompany me outside. I was
                  nervous about having her be seen outside, considering her
                  horns were yet to be dulled and her tail was undoubtedly
                  oversized, but once she was in public, nobody seemed to care.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Of course, considering her tail, I had to take her to an Aiom
                  clothing outlet, the logic of which she couldn’t comprehend.
                  She insisted that there would be clothes for her at any
                  woman’s clothing store. The easiest way I found to answer her
                  questions was to just say “It doesn’t work like that around
                  here.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“This city is weird,” she said at one point.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At the Aiom store itself - the one in Brooklyn at the mall
                  area around Atlantic Avenue - there was thankfully an
                  assistant (Also an Aiom… The economy is so bizarre now)
                  willing to help her find something. The assistant kept
                  returning to me asking what I wanted Isabelle to wear after
                  she wasn’t able to give a straight answer, so I just told them
                  to suggest things for her and see if she likes it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I left her for almost an hour to buy groceries and other
                  things. Upon returning, I found her in a new robe, something
                  stylized after a sci-fi fantasy setting. The rest of her
                  chosen clothes were robes as well, equally unusual. I asked if
                  she’d rather choose something more casual. She didn’t see the
                  problem. She explained also that she wasn’t comfortable in
                  anything tight-fitting like jeans or shirts, which I couldn’t
                  contest, even if I was the one paying for it. But there are so
                  many more conventional things she could have chosen from… If
                  only people didn’t decorate their Aioms with so many fantasy
                  elements.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She didn’t even want shoes, since apparently she found any she
                  put on to be too tight. I didn’t want her walking around the
                  city barefoot though, so I helped her find sandals instead,
                  which she was able to tolerate.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I think she looks like a complete dork, but what Aioms are. A
                  bunch of dorks in cosplay.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But she was happy with it. So much so that she randomly
                  stopped someone on the street to tell them about how nice I
                  was for getting her new clothes and giving her a place to live
                  and whatever else. I assured the stranger that I did not make
                  her say any of that. He gave me a weird look, as if I was the
                  weird one in this city.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The train trip back home was cramped. I watched Isabelle look
                  around at all the oddities curiously, mainly the Aioms. She
                  left my side and wandered through the cart, shamelessly making
                  eye contact with whoever she observed next and entering their
                  personal space. I couldn’t hear the conversation completely,
                  but she spoke with an Aiom - a human female model with a shelf
                  of a chest - for a moment, then with her owner - a stumpy
                  looking man, the sort that was likely to smell like smoke. She
                  returned to my side before being swept away with the moving
                  crowd.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What did you say to them?” I asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “That woman is so gorgeous, I just had to complement her. I’ve
                  never seen a woman like that before,” she said, something of
                  the sort.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “They’re everywhere here. That woman, I’ve seen three copies
                  of her in the same cart before.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What? How?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“She’s an Aiom. A popular model.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>She looked off in thought.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Do you or do you not know what Aioms are?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Not really.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “You said you weren’t an Aiom, though,” I said in a whisper.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Well, I know I’m not an Aiom, of course. I’m a person,” she
                  spoke loudly, unaware of the weight in her words. A few folks
                  turned their heads.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Quiet for a moment,” I told her.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  When we left the train at our stop in Astoria, a man came to
                  my side and asked if he heard Isabelle correctly. I
                  immediately became nervous and told him I didn’t know what he
                  was talking about, but he pushed and asked if I was able to
                  disable her Aiom awareness, and if I would be willing to do
                  the same for his Aioms. Isabelle was about to interject when I
                  yelled at the guy to back off. Thank God nobody cares when
                  someone yells in the station. I feel like I look insane in any
                  situation where I have to raise my voice. It doesn’t help that
                  I’m pulling Isabelle along like a parent.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle was confused about the interaction when we arrived
                  home, so I tried to run through her knowledge on Aioms one
                  more time: as she said earlier, she didn’t know what an Aiom
                  was whatsoever. I asked why she acted like she understood me
                  on the concept when we first met.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I assumed you knew more than me, so I listened,” she
                  answered.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “And yet you don’t believe me when I say that you are an
                  Aiom?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I’ve no reason to believe it.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I explained the specifics of Aioms, and how I work at the sole
                  manufacturer of them even. She still disagreed after all that,
                  even when I compared her to the appearance of Aioms.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “What do you think about the possibility that you’ve been
                  modified to deny your Aiom identity?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I don’t think anything of it except that it’s wrong.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She asked about my intentions in relation to believing that
                  she is an Aiom. I said that, in order to help her, I have to
                  understand her, and these features of hers are the only lead I
                  have at the moment. She didn’t have the memory of anything
                  from the past to argue with me, so she just accepted the
                  disagreement.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Then she wanted to clean. I still don’t know what her
                  obsession with cleaning the house is, but, now that the
                  sunlight was coming through and my attention was drawn to it,
                  my place really was an eyesore. I don’t know why I’d ever have
                  any pride about living in an original brownstone in Astoria
                  when I wouldn’t even keep my place clean. Isabelle’s apparent
                  amnesia might have blurred memories of a previous home… One
                  that was cleaner and more welcoming. Then again, as I’ve
                  described, she just wants to pay her debts, albeit
                  aggressively.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I now lean away from the theory that she wanted to do chores
                  due to the innate desire of Aiom AI to provide service. She
                  didn’t know how to clean. The whole idea of it was vague to
                  her, yet the concept was clearly substantial enough in her
                  mind to bring it up. So I spent the remainder of the day
                  helping her clean up my home while showing her all the basics.
                  Thankfully there was almost nothing that needed showing twice,
                  so she wasn’t dumb, something I didn’t want to see her as.

                  The joy she expressed from cleaning the place was quite
                  special. I don’t know when was the last time I did something
                  so mundane but still enjoyed it. After a few hours, she was
                  exhausted and ready to crash again. If I didn’t know any
                  better, I’d think that she never had to do a single chore
                  ever. I know of Aioms who are customized to be worshiped by
                  their owners. There is somewhat of an angelic nature I can
                  imagine being deliberate in her design.

                  Or, as I often do, I’m just overthinking it. She is more
                  likely just an Aiom that’s been rarely active and has no
                  memory of anything.

                  My home’s far from perfect, but it’s much cleaner than before
                  now. I suppose having someone to hold me accountable, or at
                  least embarrass me for my living state, provides some benefit.
                  I should probably just go back to having roommates again like
                  in college, and purposefully seek out some obnoxious uptight
                  ones who are vegan and activists, so that I can simulate the
                  childhood of having an authority figure always judging my
                  every decision.

                  Isabelle is sleeping on the couch as I type this, and I’m
                  falling asleep myself. It’s difficult to be alone with her,
                  let alone in the same house, so I’ll just go back to the
                  office tomorrow. I’m still not sure what I have for her to do
                  while I’m gone, but hopefully I figure something out before
                  then.
