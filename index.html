                  Today I fulfilled my promise and took Isabelle around the
                  city.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’ve moved past the glamor and awe that is New York, having
                  adjusted to the same views and spectacles without feeling much
                  new perspective on anything around me. It was therefore a
                  breath of fresh air to experience firsthand the perspective of
                  someone who was genuinely fascinated by their surroundings.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I showed Isabelle how to use the subway and all its specifics:
                  paying the fare, the difference between up- and downtown, not
                  giving money to just anyone she sees. During all that, I
                  showed her the typical spots of Manhattan that everyone loses
                  their heads over, including the Empire State Building.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Wow, you work there?” She was amazed by the scale of it. I’m
                  happy that she thought the building was neat too.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Beyond the 34th area, I showed her the rest of Midtown,
                  leading up to Central Park, where she wanted to explore all
                  its paths even further. I was worried she’d eventually grow
                  tired of walking in her sandals, but she never complained.
                  Here I was feeling exhausted after the first couple miles.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Most of our conversations while we walk mainly consist of her
                  asking specific questions and me trying to give accurate
                  answers.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Why are all the streets straight?” she asked, something of
                  the sort.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “A lot of big cities plan their streets into a grid for
                  efficiency.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“There’s other cities like this?!”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Several, yes. It doesn’t mean they are the same, though.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“How’s that?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“There’s a lot of history behind the differences.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>And etc.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>She asks questions like a kid, really.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I also took her to a library to check out some books for her.
                  It’s inconvenient that she can’t get a library card as an
                  Aiom, but I think it’s reasonable to just let her use my own
                  provided it’s implied to be an ‘errand’ for me. She picked
                  out, following my suggestions, a few books on New York
                  history, cooking, and a middle school novella that I mentioned
                  I once read when I was younger. It made me feel a little
                  special when she picked it out for that reason.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I keep thinking about how her personality will develop over
                  time, perhaps to the point of worrying. I probably need to
                  accept that it’ll take a long time before she shows any
                  identity beyond being an impressionable, happy woman. Not that
                  there is any need to rush it anyway.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I have to say, though, I am optimistic about her future. I
                  believe that, in time, she will be able to prove herself to
                  anyone as a person.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But I can’t help but feel that this is all still wrong, even
                  in the pursuit of what I believe is good. Even in the pursuit
                  of what I personally want. If Isabelle were to be turned off
                  forever and put down, she would never have to suffer from the
                  side effects of once having been an Aiom, nor would she have
                  to suffer from the hell that is this world at times. On the
                  other hand, she would never have the chance to experience the
                  wonders of this world. Wonders that are apparently contained
                  within the most mundane parts of life.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I just don’t know if it is right for me to play any authority
                  in that decision, which I undeniably have.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I guess, really, I’m just afraid of letting the disgusting
                  monster inside me dictate what I do, no matter how subtle its
                  guidance.
                </span>
