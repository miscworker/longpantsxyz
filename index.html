                  Oh, I dread this coming weekend. Today’s events have reminded
                  me of the terrifying life that is idling.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  After work at just before five in the evening, I received a
                  text from an old friend, Thomas. We went to college together
                  in California - he studied finance and advanced economics.
                  Something of that sort, I think. For whatever reason, after we
                  graduated, we never stayed in touch and haven’t spoken since.
                  I recall him saying that he was heading to San Francisco to
                  work in one of the big companies out there.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Apparently he isn’t in SF. I called him like he texted me to,
                  and he told me he was living down in Tribeca as of last month.
                  He invited me to come down and see him right then and there. I
                  didn’t really have an excuse nor reason not to see him, but I
                  didn’t think it would be a good idea.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I know for a fact that however Thomas envisioned me would be
                  better than whatever I was now. Even if he expected me to be
                  the same Stanley from when we both graduated, he would still
                  be imagining a better version of myself.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Still, in my boring, unsocial life, it felt contradictory to
                  my own needs to say no to him. So I went.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Thomas lives in a luxury condo in a newer building, one that
                  was sandwiched right between two older ones. It was quite
                  ugly, reminiscent of that irregularly shaped one also in
                  Tribeca which I can’t be bothered to look up the address of.
                  His place itself was remarkable, like the sort of apartment
                  influencers love to show off around here (While simultaneously
                  commenting on the city’s decline. Money through negativity).
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Thomas himself is… generic. I hate to say that, but that is
                  the most honest way I can put it. He’s become generic. Of
                  course, I don’t recall what made him exactly unique in
                  college, either. It’s often okay to be generic though, as long
                  as you are a good person and friend. He talked like a bro from
                  California while I was there, reminding me of how I used to
                  behave around him. He’s grown out his beard and has a more
                  adult haircut now, versus his younger clean face and raggy
                  brown hair. The most jarring thing about him now is how
                  muscular he’s become. It feels like we’ve switched places -
                  I’m the scrawny looking guy now, which looks even worse given
                  how tall I am.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  His time in San Francisco was a bumpy time, he said. He got
                  offered a job in an investing agency based in the WTC and came
                  right over without a second thought. Good for him. He was all
                  over me working at Aiom Corp, knowing that was my dream and
                  all. I didn’t have the heart to tell him how I felt about it
                  now, especially after he showed me the Aiom he had in his
                  house. If she was just a regular servant, I would have let it
                  go - the man had a lot of money to spare, after all - but no,
                  she had to be a voluptuous model dressed in a typical
                  housemaid outfit. He spoke of her objectively while she was
                  within earshot.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Yes, that too could have been forgivable, but the way he
                  insisted that we went out and had fun together at a bar or
                  club just made me feel more distant from him. I know I’m
                  absolutely wrong for thinking less of him, but I couldn’t find
                  any maturity in him, even after hearing about his success in
                  investing. Hell, I was there in his condo in Tribeca. It’s
                  hard for the average man to become more successful than that.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Maybe I’m just jealous that he can have fun with ideas like
                  that while I just feel isolated.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I tried my best to not lay any negativity onto him. I passed
                  on his suggestion to go out, which turned into a plea before
                  he finally accepted that I was uninterested. He said I was the
                  ‘same ‘ole stickler who played everything straight.’ I suppose
                  that means he didn’t detect how upset I really was.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  What bothered me most about the visit though was how he
                  actually found out I was living here. He didn’t have my
                  number, I changed it years ago. I keep myself removed from the
                  Internet. I suppose I would have believed him if he said he
                  simply looked up my name in public records around here. I’m
                  yet to meet another Longpants.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But instead, he said he reached out to my brother, just
                  through the phone. I hadn’t talked to Steve in years, not
                  since college. I didn’t take him to be well enough in the head
                  to be comfortable with giving anyone my contact information.
                  It all felt intrusive, even if nothing about it was offensive
                  or even wrong.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  No matter what way I looked at it, it disturbed me. Even now,
                  I’m struggling to process the encounter, as mundane as it was.
                  When I’m stuck in this sort of mindset, I can go through all
                  sorts of reasons and answers and never come to a satisfying
                  conclusion.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>Am I scared of meeting an old friend?</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Is it because they might be disappointed in what I’ve become?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Or is it, more specifically, that my idealization of our
                  relationship was us assuming we both went on and succeeded
                  without ever having to see the flaws which came of us
                  inevitably? I can’t deny that I wanted to think that Thomas
                  abstained from using Aioms, and that he wouldn’t see the ghost
                  that I’ve become.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>I don’t know.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But now I have an entire weekend of no plans to ponder over
                  this and figure out why it bothers me so much.

                <br />
                <br />
                <span>An unbearable way to spend my time idling.</span>
