                  Ironically, after all the effort I put into setting this up,
                  I’m not sure where to begin with these ‘ideas’. It was enough
                  work just putting together this website. I wasn’t interested
                  in using a template from yet another redundant, self-described
                  ‘minimal’ site creator that is anything but minimal, so I made
                  my own attempt in creating something from scratch.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  (Of all the years I spent learning programming, HTML and
                  whatever else are the last areas of coding that I’ve looked
                  into)
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text06" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  There is a subject to bring forth: minimalism. What a
                  controversial thing, that one.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text09" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  An exhausting feature of the 21st century is minimalism,
                  mainly in architecture and interior design. It is a prime
                  example of the sort of problems first world citizens conjure
                  out of thin air: in a world that is too chaotic and uneasy on
                  the eyes, we strive to create homes, as well as workplaces,
                  where we can relax and escape from all the details we never
                  asked for. Details such as advertising, cluttered grocery
                  aisles, car-infested streets; trash in the gutters, a constant
                  phone light in one’s peripheral vision, blinding headlights
                  despite most streets being lit well enough. We’ve created a
                  headache for ourselves, and so we attempt to simplify our own
                  dwellings into patches of white, gray, and black.

                  Places like New England and the rest of the Northeastern U.S.
                  used to seem so romantic to me, a copy-paste suburbanite born
                  in a cookie cutter town with no ambition in identity
                  whatsoever. The display of wealth, no matter how small, was
                  obvious in buildings and the community, a living proof of
                  hardship and struggle for visitors to witness. New York City
                  impressed me most of all with its density… I’m not interested
                  in losing myself over a place which has made an obvious enough
                  impression though. We all know that New York City was great.

                  Manhattan has experienced the worst of it for decades, losing
                  its historical buildings to developers who construct soulless,
                  overpriced condominiums in its place. The storefronts of these
                  buildings, if they have any at all instead of a lobby assisted
                  by a doorman, are overpriced and taken up and abandoned by one
                  business after another, until it is taken up by a corporation
                  like yet another fast food chain, one that will inevitably do
                  well. And that is what real estate development in Manhattan is
                  like: it caters only to what will inevitably succeed. The bar
                  is too high for anyone to make an attempt unless they wish to
                  lose everything. The only people who may afford a comfortable
                  place to live must be willing to put all of their income
                  towards the rent, all just for the convenience that is a major
                  city and the stupid confidence that comes with saying, ‘I live
                  in Manhattan.’
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text21" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This would almost be fine if each of these developments were
                  remotely interesting, but they are from it. In place of
                  interesting masonry and details holding centuries’ worth of
                  inspiration are flat, colorless facades learnt from only just
                  over a half-century of modernism. The concept of beauty has
                  been mistaken for oversimplification. Facades of the greatest
                  buildings in the city are immaculate permanent displays of
                  wealth - what is to be taken from a building that states that
                  it is expensive simply due to location or its services? They
                  display no permanence in its existence - they are current,
                  destined to one day be swept away with the sea of change.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text24" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The city has also overbuilt itself in sight of overpopulation.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text27" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  New York City, as well as any major city that is too unique in
                  its own right, suffers from a destructive positive feedback
                  loop. Its own popularity brings in more people than it can
                  handle because it is unique - there are practically only two
                  other options in all of America for settling in if you are
                  searching for a walkable major city with great transit and
                  reliable professional work, or at least three in total which
                  are comparable. These three would of course be San Francisco,
                  Chicago, and New York (Los Angeles has a long way to go).
                  There are a great number of folks who needn’t live in New York
                  but do so for immigration and opportunity reasons. Chicago
                  faces harsher winters and is more off path; San Francisco has
                  reasons I admit to being ignorant of.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text30" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  New York’s prime location and prominence thus makes it too
                  limited of a resource for too many people after it. I should
                  know - I am an example of one of these people. My work and
                  education did not bring me here, but rather its allure.
                  Perhaps if the rest of the country was not paved and developed
                  in favor of single-family suburban housing and car-centric
                  cults, there would be more options. Of course, this is not a
                  wonder - this is a fact. There would be limitless options in a
                  country as enormous and populated as America.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text33" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This means that, in a place with always someone willing to
                  rent a place at any location within Queens, Brooklyn, or
                  Manhattan (the Bronx’s stigma is both unfair yet often true,
                  and Staten Island is Staten Island), developers are free to
                  make whatever atrocities they desire so long as the property
                  returns profit in some form. An ugly apartment building is
                  still an apartment building. It is an inevitability, I admit,
                  but there should be enough eyes on this by now that
                  communities begin to care, but communities too few and far in
                  between these days.
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text36" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I understand that people believe that any topic of housing is
                  a difficult issue to address, and anything relating to the
                  appearance of something is subjective. I disagree.
                  Oversimplification of architecture is an eyesore, and it
                  bleeds with consequences and is coextensive with many other
                  matters, including the encroaching sameness of a once visually
                  diverse city in pursuit of a greenwashed world that ignores
                  the fundamentals of intelligent street design, all happening
                  too fast (Just look at the Bronx and the encroaching sameness
                  that is its sea of big box apartments).
                </span>
                <br class="longpantsxyz-text39" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  And to think that, in sight of a still overpopulated city - in
                  the very same city where the plague of project slums was
                  conjured in enormous numbers - we bring up suggestions of
                  copy-paste highrises to solve our solution of a housing
                  shortage, all while prices continue to increase and more and
                  more people look at the center of the world that is New York
                  with interest.

                  Maybe it is not insane, but it definitely is something.
