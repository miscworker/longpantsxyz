                  Isabelle asked if she could come along to work today.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Interestingly enough, employees are allowed to take their Aiom
                  companions onto the work campus. Having your partner accompany
                  you at work apparently makes you a lot happier. It would have
                  been an interesting experience for her, but I don’t like the
                  idea of taking an illegally made Aiom to the company that
                  produces them. Her tail was just too obvious of an issue, and
                  I still haven’t tended to her horns.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She then asked if I could stay around instead of going into
                  work. I didn’t want her to become bored again, so I took her
                  to the local library and showed her how she can find whatever
                  she’d like to read, and that she can maybe discover some new
                  interests to pursue. I left her with my phone number in case
                  she had to call me from the library, some cash to eat at a
                  restaurant across the street if she became hungry - stressing
                  to her to not order more than the thirty dollars I gave her -
                  and directions to wait for me after work to take her home. I
                  wasn’t entirely confident in letting her find her way home
                  just yet.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Nothing came about at work until three in the afternoon, when
                  I received a call from an unknown number. I assumed it was
                  Isabelle from the library, but it was instead Isabelle on a
                  cell phone all the way up in the Bronx. Apparently she went on
                  a bit of an adventure, something I wasn’t filled in on until I
                  picked her up and we took the train home.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  According to her, she browsed for books and read for a few
                  hours, while also asking people for help in looking for
                  ‘interesting things so she can learn to help people.’
                  Apparently that meant asking everyone including regular
                  patrons at the library going about their business. Eventually
                  one of the librarians had to ask her to stop bothering others,
                  so Isabelle asked her for assistance.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  However it was that Isabelle phrased it, the librarian
                  suggested that she explored volunteer work. Today, a woman by
                  the name of Elizabeth was collecting local compost from the
                  library’s dropoff to take to a playground near Mosholu Parkway
                  in the Bronx. Isabelle offered a hand and accompanied
                  Elizabeth up there and spent the remainder of her time helping
                  her dig up and plant seeds and soil. She then called me on
                  Elizabeth’s phone.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The phone call gave me no information except the address to
                  pick her up from and that she was fine and busy doing
                  volunteer work (She said that phrase very proudly - ‘volunteer
                  work’). I assumed it would’ve been a public location when I
                  arrived, but it was instead Elizabeth’s townhome where she
                  invited Isabelle in for coffee.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I went from stressed out as hell to relieved but irritated as
                  hell. I suppose she isn’t going to listen flawlessly to
                  anything I tell her either, but this is the sort of behavior
                  I’m trying to witness. It’s just stressful having a bit of an
                  uncontrollable research project walking around. I still don’t
                  know if she might be sought after by anyone for whatever
                  reason.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But it went as peacefully as a change in plans could go.
                  Elizabeth is an older woman who tends to the nearby parks and
                  food pantry, which Isabelle said she wants to go and volunteer
                  at next. She is nice and I have nothing to complain about her
                  at all, but my first question to her was - in a private
                  conversation - if it was normal in any world for her to let
                  who she assumes is someone else’s Aiom come with her to do
                  volunteer work.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  To that, she said, something of the sort, “She didn’t say she
                  was anyone’s Aiom. Or even an Aiom at all, for that matter. So
                  if she wanted to help, I’m not going to turn it down. It’s not
                  as if there’s a line for these things.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It was a bit of a shocker to meet someone who was able to
                  accept the humanity of an Aiom. Or perhaps she, no offense,
                  was simply amused by Isabelle’s behavior. In this instance,
                  I’ll be optimistic and assume the former. She asked if
                  Isabelle can come around in the future, to which I responded
                  that it’s entirely up to her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  After she told me her little adventure on the way home (Here
                  it is saved of the details of moving the compost and planting
                  various seeds in a community garden), I asked if she knowingly
                  left the area in Queens despite me asking her not to. She said
                  she completely forgot. I explained to her how worried I was
                  when she said she was elsewhere, stopping myself when I
                  realized how possessive I sounded, then I asked if she could
                  stay put until Saturday, when I’ll show her how to navigate
                  the city without me. She agreed.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Why are you so worried for me?” she asked, “I don’t see what
                  there is to be afraid of here.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  After looking for a way to phrase it, I came up with, “Because
                  you’re the most interesting thing to enter my life in a while,
                  and I can’t bear to see you go away before I fully understand
                  you.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Ohh. Okay. I’m sorry.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She then told me, upon being asked, that she gave her thirty
                  dollars to a man asking for money outside. Elizabeth said she
                  has the heart of an angel.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>I say she is an impressionable dork.</span>
