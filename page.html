                  An important order came in the mail today: an attachable
                  antenna for my computer.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The question as to whether or not Isabelle was being tracked
                  or emitting a signal had to be answered if she was going to
                  continue living in my apartment.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The answer is no. There’s no signal coming from her
                  whatsoever.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It was anticlimactic. Even disappointing, actually, as it
                  muddles the mystery to her even further. But at least I don’t
                  have to worry about that anymore.
                </span>
                <br />

                  Isabelle wanted to try cooking today. I’m thankful that she
                  waited until I was around so that I didn’t come home to a
                  burnt-up kitchen. After using my computer to research recipes,
                  she settled on fish stew with salmon. I’m no chef myself, so
                  the most I could assist her with was getting the ingredients
                  and making sure she knew how to use the stove. There was also
                  a shortage of cooking utensils and other items I had to stock
                  the kitchen with… It’s a miracle I’m not a fatter person from
                  solely eating out, but I suppose I’ve lost my appetite over
                  the years anyway.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Since I could only demonstrate so much for her, Isabelle
                  realized the miracle that is the internet and its ability to
                  provide her with whatever information she needed. She watched
                  video tutorials for every step in preparation and repeatedly
                  asked if she was doing things right. She absorbed everything
                  well enough; her biggest strength I’ve noticed so far is how
                  receptive she is to everything. I guess that could balance out
                  into being a flaw if she finds an interest in something not
                  particularly rewarding.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  When the stew was finished, she took a spoon and tasted it.
                  The joy which appeared in her eyes was like a sun appearing
                  through a brief opening in overcast; when all the effort pulls
                  through and success prevails, and the journey fulfilled makes
                  the destination so much more pleasurable.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I feel even a little jealous that she can experience something
                  so wonderful.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The food tasted wonderful. Maybe not so much that it was
                  actually done well, but more so because it was cooked at home
                  and I witnessed it, both of which I haven’t experienced for
                  unreasonably too long.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’ve noticed that when Isabelle eats, she looks intently at
                  her food. Not in any gluttonous way, but rather curiously. She
                  seemed much more intelligent about it with her own cooking, as
                  if studying its intricacies would lead her to improve her own
                  meals in the future. When she’d bite it, she ate slowly and
                  sometimes closed her eyes and seemed lost in thought. She
                  caught me staring one of the times after opening her eyes and
                  laughed it off.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I told her afterwards that I’ll buy her whatever she needed
                  for cooking.
