                  Before I talk about Isabelle, I want to comment on something I
                  saw today. I’m going to omit the product name because I don’t
                  care to advertise for them (Explaining the ad is extensive
                  enough.)
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  There are these ads for a social media app in the subway
                  stations, split as a two part ad on two separate posters. The
                  first is a blank white canvas with typeface font text reading
                  nothing but ‘Less social media.’ It features zero other
                  labels.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The other is a poster with an obnoxious amount of artificial
                  content, captioned ‘More (Social media name).’ It links to a
                  website describing the intent of their social media app versus
                  others. It explains how social media apps make people unhappy
                  and feel like strangers to others, an undoubtedly true fact.
                  It then goes on to say why their app is different and how it
                  apparently makes its users happier. One feature of its app it
                  clarifies is that conversations made on there automatically
                  delete because then it is more like ‘real life.’
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The claims it makes about the issues of social media are true,
                  but, as usual, it is all pushed just in the goal of selling a
                  product. Maybe what irritates me the most is just the
                  deliberately cluttered ad full of artificial, manufactured
                  monstrosities that are apparently supposed to imply something
                  personal or real? I don’t understand it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  There is nothing heartfelt ever about pushing a product onto
                  others, especially ones engineered to be addictive for young
                  people especially. Perhaps such things wouldn’t be necessary
                  if the country wasn’t itself manufactured or artificial.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle cleaned the house further out of boredom. This is
                  when I came to the obstacle that was her apparent lack of
                  personality.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  When I arrived home, she told me she had stayed inside all
                  day, just like I requested, but she ‘needed to do something or
                  else.’ Aioms are normally hardwired to never feel bored, so I
                  imagine that the sensation of waiting for something to happen
                  but being forced to stay put probably drove her mad.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Although, if she claims to not be an Aiom, there is nothing
                  actually stopping her from going out if she pleases. I
                  realized this and decided that her own sanity is more
                  important than her safety, as disagreeable as most would find
                  that, and I took her out to make a copy of my keys for her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I only realize now, considering that she has only been in the
                  house for about three days, how strange my decision is. At the
                  same time, I can’t be bothered to care.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In an effort to respect her, I explained to her the realism of
                  the situation.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I know you say that you’re not an Aiom,” I said, something of
                  the sort, “And I’ll believe you for as long as you say so.
                  However, here in New York*, you will be confused for an Aiom.
                  This means that you might be treated differently by people
                  around here if you aren’t with me. Sometimes, if you aren’t
                  doing certain things or acting a certain way, you’ll be asked
                  what your ‘current errand’ is. This is because Aioms are made
                  to serve humans, so that’s what you’d be expected to do: to
                  serve me, wherever I might be.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “If you’re ever asked what you’re doing, and you’re unsure,
                  just say you’re out on an errand for your owner. Otherwise, I
                  think you should be alright.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  *I find it easier to imply that things are different here in
                  the city, just to avoid any confusion with how the world
                  works.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She thanked me and immediately tried to go on her way in a
                  random direction, until I asked if she knew how to make her
                  way home. Of course she didn’t. I suggested that she first let
                  me show her the city before she went around on her own.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  While at home as I made dinner (Pasta is all I'm capable of
                  cooking with confidence), she brought up an interesting
                  question to me.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Stanley, what do you do all day?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She expected a very precise answer. I told her I work on
                  weekdays, eight hours a day. I spend probably an hour and a
                  half commuting everyday, at max. I sleep between six and eight
                  hours every night. That leaves me with six to eight and a half
                  hours everyday. If I spend another two hours eating, waking
                  up, and getting ready for work, then I have at least four
                  hours every day to do whatever I please.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “What do you do in those four hours, then?” she asked.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Not really anything.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“You do nothing?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I do not do ‘really anything.’”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What does that mean?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It didn’t really mean anything. I don’t have much else to do.
                  But I just told her that it means I do whatever has to be
                  taken care of. When that answer didn’t suffice, I just told
                  her that I’m not certain.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It was an uncomfortable question for me. If she is this sort
                  of blank canvas of a person who knows little about anything,
                  then posing an equally boring impression upon her cannot be
                  exactly a great entry into the real world.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So I corrected myself to her and admitted that I’m obsessed
                  with Aioms, and similar concepts as well. The artificial
                  methods of technology used to fulfill human needs in place of
                  consequently lost natural methods fascinates me.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“That’s why you work at Aiom Corp!” she said.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Rightly so,” I said. And other reasons, I thought.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She asked about my work, and I described my job and whatever
                  else. She said I must be really smart to do something like
                  that. I didn’t really have much of a response - thanking her
                  didn’t sit right with me.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Hey, could I get a job?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know. Just a job.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What do you want to do?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What are you good at, then?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Do you think I’m good at cleaning?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I smirked. My reaction is probably akin to some sort of
                  cultural or demographic concept that’s better to avoid, but I
                  didn’t want to lead her down just doing something she would
                  have been stuck doing as an Aiom.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Sure, but there’s a lot of other things you could try
                  learning. Is there anything in the world that you like?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Try to actually think about it first.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She exaggeratedly entered deep thought, sitting like the
                  Thinker sculpture on the couch. I imagined that there had to
                  be some lingering memories within her that could create a
                  preference for something.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I think,” she said, very slowly like she was unsure, “That I
                  like to see people be happy.”

                  I imagine that this statement was born out of the Aiom AI
                  influence on the brain, even being deactivated (If it was,
                  anyway). The AI ensures Aiom well-being by guaranteeing a
                  positive response in the brain when satisfying owners, or
                  humans in general, in whatever way they’re asked. If I’m
                  correct, this permanently restructures the brain.
                  Brainwashing, essentially.

                  But… at least it’s vague enough to allow for many
                  opportunities, right?

                  “That’s good,” I told her, “There’s a lot of ways to make
                  people happy.”

                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Like how?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I think you should find that out yourself.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“How do I do that, then?”</span>

                  This is generally how most of our conversations have gone so
                  far. It is very difficult to not condescend to her by mistake.

                  It makes me feel even more pathetic to think that this is the
                  most I’ve interacted with someone outside of work or therapy
                  since college.
