                  Let me clarify, before I put any opinion of mine on the
                  Internet, something important about myself: I am in no way
                  radical, obsessive, or a believer of any conspiracy out there.
                  I also do not believe I could ever hurt anything larger than a
                  fly. If I somehow hurt anyone in the world with my words
                  alone, I absolutely did not intend for it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Now to introduce myself more formally: my name is Stanley
                  Longpants. I have worked at Aiom Corp in Manhattan for ten
                  years, as of today. My official job title is 'Senior Aiom
                  Personality AI Expert.' Someone familiar with the corporate
                  world may notice how vaguely that title implies my actual
                  responsibilities. I believe that might be on purpose, so that
                  I cannot contest what I am asked of when my upper requires it,
                  although this is probably a resolved issue in the job contract
                  anyway. Whatever.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Aiom Corp is very likely the most unique single private
                  company in the entire world. No other organization beholds
                  such a powerful combination of departments involved in either
                  biological research or artificial intelligence. This is
                  probably a given to most people familiar with Aioms, which, at
                  this point, might as well be at least two-thirds of the world.
                  They make ‘organic robots’ for the average consumer, or
                  whatever else you want them simplified to - who else does?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But it is seriously understated how ridiculously powerful Aiom
                  Corp is. If it were not for the oil industry, I would easily
                  call them the most powerful in the world, but subsidized,
                  private automobile ownership exists, and that will reign
                  supreme for as long as there is oil to be sold. Despite that,
                  the extent that artificial intelligence has entered our
                  everyday lives through the form of fake humans has reached a
                  critical point of requiring assessment.

                <br />
                <span>
                  I swear that I am not a Ted Kaczynski. (I will admit that he
                  makes valid points. I also admit that he was clearly ignorant
                  to the value that industrial progress has brought the human
                  race, but enough has been said about his views by this point.)
                  My views are not driven by religious bias. Of course I cannot
                  help but have a personal bias towards the state of things, but
                  what isn’t personal in one’s life? And I am certainly also not
                  bought or paid for by anyone. These are all thoughts of my
                  own, gathered after years of studying, researching, and
                  assessing the state of things, not professionally but as a
                  hobby.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  With all that said, I feel like I am the only sane person who
                  realizes how awful America has become.

                  However, this blog does not exist to write a manifesto. There
                  is not a single manifesto ever that did much good in the
                  world, at least by my definition of what a manifesto is. It
                  makes me cringe to admit, but this blog will probably be
                  nothing more than a place to vent my own frustrations into an
                  empty void and nothing more, as suggested by my one and only
                  friend, Dr. Harbinger.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  (To satisfy her request, Dr. Harbinger asks that I not use her
                  name in reference to her, and to clarify that our relationship
                  is purely therapist to patient. She is the doctor, I am the
                  patient.)
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Harbinger has been at the front of my dam of frustrations for
                  a little over a year now in the form of biweekly one hour
                  sessions. She has heard all that I have had to say about
                  Aioms, recent city development, the state of American politics
                  on all levels of government, ongoing environmental
                  destruction, capitalized addiction, and my lack of friends or
                  a relationship.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She told me that I have a lot of ideas that could use
                  polishing on paper. I never considered myself a writer, but I
                  have little else happening these days, aside from a stalled
                  project and my job. Maybe the view of my thoughts combined
                  with my reflection on the screen would do me some good.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This post will serve as an intro to my blog. I don’t intend to
                  keep a strict schedule for this, but Harbinger suggested that
                  I tend to it at least weekly. To anyone who stumbles across
                  this, forgive me if my demeanor intimidates. I swear I do not
                  mean to condescend to any folks.
