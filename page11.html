                  Recent news that I have been invested in surrounds the
                  inclusion of AI in arts and entertainment.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I play no part in the arts or entertainment industry, but I am
                  certainly an artist in the world of programming. Such work was
                  deemed to be threatened by AI ever since it gained traction
                  through public accessible programs, but any sensitive work
                  involving the safety of individuals is just too risky to put
                  into the hands of an unintelligent mind.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Though, such a statement begs the question of what the
                  definition of an intelligent mind is, let alone a mind at all.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Point is: my job, in all of the past ten years of increasing
                  AI use, has never been threatened by it. If anything were to
                  change, it would simply degrade into reviewing work of
                  automatically generated code, which, in my opinion, would
                  require so much correction that my job title would be the only
                  actual change.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In the entertainment industry, though, goodness. What hell it
                  must be for artists right now.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Despite the layoffs and unsuccessful strikes, I think art is
                  far from dead. The entertainment industry is destined to
                  strive for maximum efficiency in product making - it is an
                  industry, in the end. The inclusion of creative liberty and
                  the arts does not make it any less of an assembly line than a
                  factory processing and boxing milk into cartons. Art itself
                  though, however, adapts and evolves, as always.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In fact, here is a controversial opinion of mine: it is good
                  that this has happened to the entertainment industry. Even
                  before the use of AI, workers were subjected to unfair
                  conditions and practices at all levels, all just to produce a
                  ridiculous amount of garbage media that goes unnoticed or
                  immediately forgotten. Now that AI is used to speed up the
                  process, what has changed? That the products they produce are
                  now even more noticeably low effort?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I admit that my opinion is biased by the fact that I find the
                  world overwhelming. However, I think we can all agree that
                  there is little artistic pride in any piece of media that is
                  manufactured for profit. If people wish to find meaningful
                  creations made by humans instead of machines, all they need to
                  do is look for, well, actual art films. No, they wonâ€™t be full
                  of CGI nonsense that people apparently need in every one of
                  their movies nowadays, but they will definitely have more
                  heart than the average summer blockbuster. More than that
                  though, look locally and you will find art in all sorts of
                  places. If there is none to be found, be an artist yourself
                  and make something. It is in our nature, after all, to leave
                  our mark on the world.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Not to consume the mark, turned into a consumable product, of
                  a corporation. We need to be made more aware of the
                  factory-produced products that the average product of the
                  entertainment industry is.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Programming and most technical things are usually only
                  considered artforms by people within its circle. My job is far
                  from ever being considered art by the public view.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But at least I can take pride knowing that my work, which is
                  well respected by my peers, is unique, applicable, and is made
                  entirely by me. In a patch, my solution to a problem is sent
                  to Aioms all over the country. It is a mark that goes
                  unnoticed, but it is still there. In a way, my presence
                  exceeds that of the average person. My influence is not grand,
                  perhaps, but underestimated.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Remember that the next time your Aiom stops alerting the
                  authorities over a roomba possibly being a bomb.
