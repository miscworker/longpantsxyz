                  I had totally forgotten what happened in my reunion with
                  Thomas days ago. Isabelle has had me preoccupied to the point
                  that I haven’t even had the time to reflect on the fact that I
                  was considering suicide.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Now that I’ve a clearer head - I think, anyway - it all seems
                  so melodramatic. Which is just another way of saying that I
                  can be quite stupid. Of course Thomas is going to have an
                  Aiom. He’s a single man who's always had a bachelor attitude
                  and no shame in his desires. To think that he’d have the pride
                  to not purchase an Aiom was entirely just me being in denial.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I reached out to him today to apologize for blowing him off.
                  He said it was all fine and didn’t seem like he was ever upset
                  about it in the first place. Maybe it’s what he expected of me
                  even after all these years. I still excused myself from doing
                  anything with him for the time being, which he didn’t contest,
                  thankfully.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Hearing that he was fine with our encounter makes me feel a
                  lot better. I’m not sure if I really care to ever see him
                  often, or even once in a while. I’d just rather have us check
                  on each other and make sure that we’re fine.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  What led me to actually contact him again today was a thought
                  I had about my relationship with Isabelle. If I am to see her
                  as an Aiom - even if she isn’t one anymore, by definition - I
                  still am drawing some kind of pleasure from her, even if it’s
                  just through the form of curiosity and research. She would
                  then still be a living thing produced for one’s pleasure,
                  making me no different from anyone else who purchases an Aiom.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Of course, it’s a huge stretch. It wasn’t an epiphany or any
                  sort of sudden realization for me at all. I didn’t buy an
                  Aiom, aware of what it is, and took it into my home to force
                  it to do whatever I say. I’ve instead taken in a woman who
                  would otherwise be homeless, clothed her, and am seeing how
                  she’ll find her place in the world.
                </span>
                <br />
                <span>
                  (When I phrase it like that, it really sounds like I’m
                  searching for a high moral ground. If I heard this from
                  someone else, I’d be very suspicious of their actual
                  intentions.)
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  While I wrote this entry, I did have a curious thought that
                  itched at me to find something out.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle is, in subtle ways, submissive, or at least very
                  adaptive. Or perhaps oblivious? Draw your own conclusions from
                  what I describe, I suppose.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle is willing to cook for me and clean the house, do her
                  own grocery shopping now that I trust her, and check on my
                  happiness when I’m around easily every hour until she sleeps.
                  I’m willing to believe that she is just very grateful and
                  wants to pay her debts, but she did not even have a concept of
                  employment, work, money, economy, and so on until I explained
                  them to her. I don’t think she could’ve already had a concept
                  of being in debt to someone.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The other trait I want to bring up is her touchiness. I tell
                  her to stop, but she keeps on hugging. It has to be some tick
                  she has. I thought that maybe she is like this with strangers
                  too, so I told her to not hug people unprompted, but she said
                  very explicitly that she only hugs me. She also tries to hold
                  my hand in public even though I tell her that I don’t have to
                  lead her around anymore, but I realize that it’s probably
                  reasonable for her to have some recent trauma from whatever
                  events happened leading up to our first encounter. It doesn’t
                  feel right to tell anyone to stop being affectionate,
                  especially when she is mostly out of gratitude, but I’m not
                  one who can be hugged by women and react to it acceptably.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Otherwise, when it comes to all the guidance which I’ve
                  provided for her, she’s been attentive and trusting of my
                  judgment. But is that because she is grateful and accepts my
                  authority, or is her mind permanently affected by prior Aiom
                  programming which tells her to be submissive?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So I asked her, as she was preparing to sleep, if she could do
                  me a favor.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What do you need?” she asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I need you to get something for me outside.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Get what?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Ice cream.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Ooh, you mean like a frozen treat? I don’t think I’ve ever
                  tried that!”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>I didn’t consider that.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Yeah, could you go out and get some for me?” I asked.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Okay! Where do I go?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I want you to go to a specific store, all the way in
                  Brooklyn. You have to take the G crosstown, then the F down to
                  Bay Parkway.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She looked off for a moment, as if piecing together the
                  directions in her head. I didn't expect her to actually know
                  where exactly that'd take her. “How far away is that?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “It’ll probably take you an hour and a half, maybe two hours
                  before you get back.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She looked off for another moment, then her eyes went to the
                  window, where the rain was sprinkling against the glass. “Do
                  you really want this ice cream?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Yes.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Okay, I’ll go. Where is it exactly?” She went for her coat
                  and put it on over her pajamas.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Hold on, hold on,” I stopped her, “It’s fine. You don’t have
                  to go all the way out there.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Oh. Where is it, then?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I wasn’t thinking of a particular place. I didn’t actually
                  want you to go anywhere. I just wanted to know if you’d be
                  willing to spend that much of your time on just a favor for
                  me.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “If you really wanted something that bad,” she said something
                  of the sort, “Then of course I would do it.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“But why?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Because you’ve done a lot for me,” she put simply. It was in
                  line with her usual reasoning for her choices - simple,
                  honest, and innocent. “I really want ice cream now, though.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It wouldn’t have been fair to leave her hanging, so I took her
                  out to a late night ice cream shop in the neighborhood, where
                  she supposedly tried some for the first time. She picked out
                  pistachio ice cream (Bleh) on a waffle cone and ate it up
                  while I still had half of my bowl of chocolate soft serve. She
                  insisted over and over that she was ill every time she had a
                  brain freeze. It was hilarious.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I think I’m willing to say that Isabelle makes a good, if not
                  then at least fun, friend.
