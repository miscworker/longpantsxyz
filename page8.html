                  Today’s message comes from a Leah, who said the following:

                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>

                  Stanley, I just wanted to ask of your opinion. How do you feel
                  about people using Aioms to carry out crimes? I know this
                  isn't common or anything but considering all types of people
                  purchase these fucking things theres definitely people that
                  have found ways around the programming to make them do some
                  heinous shit. You have to admit it's really fucked up that
                  people have been using Aioms to pretend that they're loved
                  ones family in danger and they'll only be spared if the victim
                  sends money like what the fuck? Stanley I need your expert
                  opinion
                </span>
                <br class="page8-text13" />

                <br />
                <span>
                  (This was only edited for spelling, just to clarify.)
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’ve heard of this apparently common scam Leah describes,
                  where people use Aioms to pose as loved ones in exchange for a
                  ransom from the target victim. I can’t say that this is not
                  real, but this practice makes no sense and requires too much
                  effort that any person willing to take so many steps for a
                  crime would realize it’s not worth bothering.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  And yet its spread as a rumor, all for the sensationalism and
                  attention it brings on social media (And the news, but the
                  news might as well be considered social media nowadays
                  considering its clickbaity nature). Probably a reason the
                  rumor succeeds is the average person’s unfamiliarity with an
                  Aiom’s limitations, usually placing unrealistic expectations
                  on them.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  First of all, as I described from the Aiom creation process in
                  a previous entry, Aioms are created from the start to be the
                  same forever. Their appearance is based on their genetics, not
                  some shapeshifting nonsense. The only reason you would be able
                  to convince a scam victim that an Aiom is their loved one is
                  if they just so happened to look like them, and, even then,
                  there are dozens of protocols in place to prevent this from
                  happening.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Again, I can’t say that this scenario is impossible, because
                  it is inevitable that an Aiom will look like a real person,
                  the same way there are lookalikes normally already. But the
                  scenario just does not make sense.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Say I am the criminal, and I just so happen to have an Aiom
                  that looks like a relative or friend of yours.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  First of all, you have to be out of contact enough with that
                  person to not be able to reach them to verify their safety.
                  Secondly, how am I delivering this threat to you? In person?
                  Over the internet? A phone call? If it is in person, well,
                  that is just trying to get myself caught. And the Aiom would
                  likely be realized if they were seen in person.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  If this was done over any digital medium at all, the Aiom
                  becomes pointless. We have countless AI tools and already
                  skilled criminals who can use editing tools, voice modulators
                  and synthesis, and whatever else to convince someone of a lie.
                  Bringing an Aiom into the operation contributes nothing.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In regards to Aioms committing crimes in general though:
                  honestly, it is more sparse than I would expect it to be. That
                  is, sparse in the public view. I think I already made a point
                  of Aioms being reprogrammed in illegal off-market operations.
                  I can assume that many are altered for sexual purposes,
                  considering how controlled the BDSM roleplay functions of
                  their programming are. That’s a whole rabbit hole I’m not
                  interested in diving into at this moment.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  As for Aioms being altered for non-sexual purposes: the issue
                  with using them for crimes involving close encounters with
                  victims or in public view is that they are all made to be
                  trackable. For Aioms which are made to not be trackable - I
                  would love to meet the folks capable of dismantling the
                  relevant devices, because they are prone to go off on the
                  network as soon as there is deliberate interference with them
                  in most cases. They’d have to be geniuses.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Jokes aside, usually Aioms are dismantled somewhere that they
                  can’t be picked up on the network. A lot of Aiom workshops are
                  far out from major cities - in the case of where I live, there
                  probably isn’t a location to discreetly dismantle the tracking
                  device for at least a few hundred miles. I won’t get into the
                  specifics because I don’t want people getting any ideas, but
                  it’s definitely not an easy task.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  However, when it is done, yes, these Aioms have been used for
                  some crimes after reprogramming them, but the entire process
                  has been largely unsuccessful, I’d say. Reprogramming an Aiom
                  in significant ways can cause serious brain trauma. The
                  initial process at which they are conditioned in the mind is
                  actually a sensitive operation requiring weeks for proper
                  adjustment. Performing a similar process again later is like
                  teaching a dog old tricks, only it can give the dog rabies and
                  make them go a little mad or cause their brain to literally
                  fry itself from overstimulation - something like that, anyway.
                  I’m not well read in the neurological part of Aioms.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  What ends up happening then, so far, is that an Aiom is sent
                  off with programmed instructions to say rob a person or steal
                  a car, but then it fails because both of these are activities
                  that they aren’t normally trained to perform (Aiom navigators
                  for any vehicle are trained with an AI not publicly available
                  to consumers). When the Aiom is busted, it’s incapable of
                  speaking, a deliberate choice of the programmer so that it
                  can’t give any information whatsoever, but then someone from
                  Aiom Corp comes along to reprogram it to function properly and
                  pry the information out of them anyway. I had the privilege of
                  taking part in a couple of cases myself, although I don’t get
                  to see the Aiom myself or any of that. Someone involved in
                  Aiom cases just makes a mirror of the Aiom’s computer’s
                  contents, sends it my way, then I fix it and send it back.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Still, it’s much more intriguing than writing code for a
                  slutty wolf Aiom. There is a lot to learn from the illegal
                  work of other programmers in regards to ensuring customer
                  safety. As much as I despise their existence as a supplement
                  for a socially failing country, at least I can keep people
                  safe and criminal mischief at bay.
