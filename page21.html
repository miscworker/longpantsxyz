                  Surprisingly, people are actually reading this blog. I came
                  home to an email from someone inquiring about Aioms.

                <br />
                <span>
                  Hi, I just came across your blog. You’re already turning my
                  world upside down with what you’re talking about. I never
                  heard about the story of that abused Aiom. Not only that, I
                  didn’t know that they were actually… alive? I don’t know how
                  to phrase it. They’ve always looked fleshy and real to me, but
                  I just assumed they were robots underneath. Especially since
                  they have the computers put on the back of their heads. I
                  guess them being real explains why they drink Aiom fluids?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Btw we do have an Aiom in the house for cleaning and stuff. I
                  just never thought to really look into it.
                </span>

                <span>Janelle</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  To this day, I’m both unsurprised yet shocked when people
                  aren’t knowledgeable on what Aioms actually are. Seriously, if
                  there was a PSA to inform the public that Aioms are in fact
                  entirely living beings, save for their microcomputer
                  manipulating their way of thinking and other body functions,
                  it’s possible that most of America would get rid of their
                  Aioms or at least virtue signal each other into treating them
                  like first class citizens.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  No offense to you, Janelle. Understand that communicating with
                  me personally will not save your lifestyle or actions from any
                  disagreements I might have. If anything, take this as an
                  opportunity to understand where Aioms come from and why we
                  need to remove their label as Aioms, strip them of their
                  enslavement, and to respect them as human beings equal to us.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The worst truth about Aioms is that they are dragged out of
                  the void of non-existence merely to be servants to us false
                  gods. In the depths of the sterile labs of Aiom Corp, a petri
                  dish is the pedestal of a genetically modified embryo of a
                  near future Aiom. We are all aware of the miracle of stem cell
                  research and genetic engineering for the medical world. The
                  roots of such engineering comes from Aiom Corp itself. Some
                  genius even managed to develop a reliable method of editing
                  the genes and combining human features with that of animals.
                  You can thank him for all the anthropomorphic people you see
                  on the street these days.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The growth process is nothing terribly interesting. The
                  embryos are grown at a rapid speed in incubators and
                  controlled chambers, the technology of which I’m not familiar
                  with, as it is not my area. Do explore the topic yourself if
                  you ever have the time though, it is all fascinating stuff.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  After about three months when the Aiom is grown to the ‘age’
                  it will be set to (all Aioms are at minimum 25 years old in
                  resemblance), they are equipped with their microcomputer which
                  interacts with their brain and nervous system through various
                  connections. The base Aiom and a specific personality AI is
                  installed onto the computer, dictating how the Aiom will
                  behave by interfering and restructuring every single thought
                  it will ever have. Methods such as classes and coma-induced
                  dream sequences are also used to restructure their thought
                  patterns and personality, like I mentioned previously in
                  another post.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Then the Aiom is sent to wherever it is destined: an Aiom
                  storefront, a testing facility, the military (No combat
                  deployment yet at this time), or directly to a customer at
                  their doorstep. Not in a box, though. If you’re in a major
                  city like New York, they will literally leave Aiom Corp and
                  travel to your home to greet you in person. What a way to make
                  any customer feel special and loved for.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The anthropomorphic part is the strangest thing about Aioms. I
                  wish I could say I didn’t understand or know where the
                  obsession with anthro characters came from, but I would be
                  lying. It has all been decades in the making, growing in the
                  public consciousness then blowing up with the Internet to the
                  point that any child born after the year 2000 has probably
                  explored the idea of romancing an anthro (Romancing a furry?
                  I’m split on what to call these things, but I think anthro
                  sounds less obnoxious).
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I wouldn’t mind the existence of anthros if they weren’t so
                  strongly associated with sexual deviancy. It is not just a
                  stigma or stereotype - it is fact. I have proof as recent as
                  today.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  My workload has increased over the years and extended to
                  occasionally having to interact with customers myself to help
                  them design their Aiom’s personalities. During these chat
                  sessions (they never want to talk in voice, considering the
                  content involved), I can see the mockup that they designed
                  using the Aiom Designer app.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The first one I saw today, created and blessed by ‘Jason P.’,
                  was one of the most cliche designs I’ve ever seen: female,
                  wolf anthro, gray fur; F-cup breasts, thick legs, six feet
                  tall, and accessorized in a black crop top and shorts. I am
                  not exaggerating when I say that I have seen a design like
                  this at least a dozen times before in just these sessions. And
                  of course, Jason wants her to be an absolute hornbug and
                  dominant in bed, but they must be super attentive and
                  submissive around the house. A glorified walking seminal
                  deposit that so happens to cook and clean the house.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’m willing to admit that I am pessimistic, but I know what I
                  am witnessing here. Pornography was bad enough for the minds
                  of growing boys everywhere. Nothing good can come out of
                  enabling sexual deviancy through capitalism which then shunts
                  their social growth and ability to make relationships in the
                  future. Nothing.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Anyways - there is your Aiom process, from the factory to your
                  doorstep, Janelle. I hope that, if you have a partner living
                  with you, you trust them around the Aiom. I assume the worst
                  out of men as much as I assume the worst of myself.
