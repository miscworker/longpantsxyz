                  The downfall of architecture in the modern city has always
                  been a stinker to me. Only a few streets in Queens alone
                  sustain their historical elegance. At least, if the
                  architecture alone is considered, otherwise the streets
                  themselves are littered with the century old problem of parked
                  cars and the new issue of greenwashed sameness.
                </span>

                  I will advocate for anything that is anti-car as much as the
                  next person: public transit, cycling, and whatever else. But
                  does that mean that every single street must be turned into a
                  road dedicated to safe traveling? When I step outside of my
                  brownstone in Astoria, a place I now have to pay a premium for
                  because a good amount of us folks are aware of the value of
                  preserved neighborhoods, I’m faced with the sameness which has
                  infected all redeveloped streets: a line of trees on either
                  side of the street, a bike lane painted in green, and parked
                  cars shoved in, giving just barely enough leeway for drivers
                  to pass through. Prior to the redesign, a few trees dotted the
                  street while cars lined the curbs bumper to bumper. All of
                  this redesign, and the street was just as cramped as it was
                  before… I am willing to concede to the need to support a dense
                  neighborhood and its commuters, but at some point the street
                  was unorganized and free for all people to pass through and it
                  was never cramped. The automobile is the culprit, so remove
                  it.

                  I admit that my personal gripe with cars probably gives me a
                  bias towards a lot of aspects of city design. They are an
                  exhausting subject to me - they’re overly abundant in America.
                  Where I grew up in Suntown, California, the suburban culture
                  was built up from scratch in the fifties for automobile owners
                  only. Thus my childhood was decided on where my parents would
                  choose to drive me, and not where I would choose to go.
                  Between school and home, I had practically no other third
                  place to spend my life. The nearest establishment to us
                  besides another house was a dry cleaners. The road asphalt in
                  the neighborhood baked in the sun seven months out of the
                  year, and there wasn’t a single tree along the sidewalk for
                  shade. There also happened to be no other children in the
                  local neighborhood that I knew of. My friends lived about two
                  miles away elsewhere, but walking there was not only hellish
                  but disallowed by my parents.

                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  And yet my father had the nerve to complain about my brother
                  and I never going outside to do anything.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It’s no wonder that I fell into programming as an interest.
                  Maybe even if I grew up in a fun, diverse place I still would
                  have found an obsession with Aioms. If anything I should have
                  been dissuaded from ever interacting with them due to my
                  father’s influence, but perhaps it is exactly his distaste for
                  them that drew me to them more and more, as if I unconsciously
                  wished to defy him.

                <span>
                  I didn’t expect to talk more about a comparably boring topic
                  like architecture or street design for the start of this blog,
                  considering how much of my life is actually just consumed by
                  Aioms instead. My mind wanders more than I’d like. If it could
                  sit still, I’d be writing a book instead, one that was
                  perfectly paced and formatted and would be able to convince
                  the world of its dark path. But instead, I decree this site as
                  a dump of my thoughts and feelings.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Not to mention, it would be interesting if there was anyone
                  out there willing to share their thoughts with me, especially
                  if they agree.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Will America continue to promote a life of unrestrained
                  indulgence and simplified sameness? Or is there hope? Please
                  convince me if there is.
