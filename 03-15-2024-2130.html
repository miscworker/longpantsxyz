                  My conversation with Isabelle yesterday had me wondering how
                  on Earth I would teach a person how to be a person. It
                  essentially means showing them everything that I know, or
                  pointing them to those who I can trust.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I’m not confident in my ability to do either. I’ve felt
                  impersonal to the world for years now - anything I can teach
                  her might just turn her into the same pessimist that I am. But
                  I’ve detached myself from society so much that I’ve no idea
                  about any social circles to direct her to either.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Thank goodness she happened to run into that woman Elizabeth
                  at the library, because I wouldn’t know who else to turn to. I
                  may just not talk to many folks anymore, but she’s the only
                  sensible person in recent memory I can think of that would
                  serve as a good role model for Isabelle. She wanted to find
                  volunteer work to do anyway, so it’s probably the morally
                  correct path to enlightenment as a person.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I called Elizabeth and asked for her assistance in teaching
                  Isabelle, a question which she thought to be amusing until I
                  explained the serious nature of it. She assured me that she’s
                  had enough kids to know how to look after someone.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “It’s adorable how much you care about her,” she told me.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle spent most of her day in Norwood doing whatever work
                  was offered to her. She helped out at a food pantry, park
                  cleanup… Apparently she led a class of elementary kids with a
                  few other chaperones as they went from their school to a park
                  for a field trip.
                </span>
                <br class="page3-text21" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She also learned how to make empanadas from Elizabeth, which
                  is now her favorite food.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “What did you take away from today’s experiences as a person,
                  then?” I asked her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “People are messy,” she answered, “There’s a lot of trash
                  everywhere. Elizabeth told me that a dirty place is a
                  reflection of the people around.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I wouldn’t go around saying that. It only takes a few people
                  to dirty up a street.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Why’s that allowed to happen, then?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “It’s not that it is allowed to happen. It’s more that it’s
                  difficult to control, based on the area. There’s a lot of
                  people in this city. You can’t track every piece of litter
                  that they make. A lot of trash just blows in from other
                  communities, too.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Ohh. You must know a lot about trash.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“That’s not at all the case,” I laughed.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Elizabeth told me privately that she disclosed Isabelle as her
                  Aiom to others for safety purposes, for the sake of keeping
                  things simple. Thankfully there is an assumption (A righteous
                  one too, I will admit) that all Aioms under legally programmed
                  control are safe around anybody, making them an ideal choice
                  for caregiving and children supervision.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  As Elizabeth described, Isabelle was great with the children,
                  interacting with them at their level and asking them all sorts
                  of questions like she does with anyone else. I wonder if her
                  behavior with children was based on her prior default Aiom AI
                  permanently affecting her mannerisms.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Isabelle, have you ever actually interacted with children
                  until today?” I asked her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Not that I remember. Why?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her response pushes that idea, but I wasn’t there to witness
                  it myself, so I can’t be sure. Personally I think Aioms being
                  around children is really odd, given their nature. Obviously
                  any Aiom that is intended to provide care or be around
                  children very often isn’t going to be as scandalous as
                  someone’s private mistress, but it’s hard to shake the stigma.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I was I think thirteen when the first Aioms were showcased.
                  They only had two models, a male and a female. Their
                  generically perfect design has to be intentional, in that they
                  were both caucasian and blonde with as moderate of proportions
                  and as healthy as one can be. It reminded me of Eye of the
                  Beholder, an episode of The Twilight Zone. We’d become the pig
                  people, in comparison to their perfection.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I didn’t care much for their appearance, but the fact that
                  their behavior was split between the human brain and their AI
                  programming was the coolest thing ever to me. In a way, it
                  still is, although my fascination with it has turned into more
                  of a concern of a problem which I am obligated to tend to,
                  since nobody else seems to have the same worries I have.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Maybe everyone else - the Aioms, their consumers, their
                  producers, advocates, anyone on their side - are the pig
                  people, and I’m the normal person wrapped in bandages.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Probably not. I’m willing to admit that I’m an outlier, but
                  that doesn’t make me any less wrong.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Funnily enough, if my dad was harsher on me than he already
                  was about my interest in Aioms and was actually able to
                  convince me to stay away from them, my life would be entirely
                  different. It actually might be better.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But that would mean there'd be something right in his actions
                  by discouraging me from doing what I want. It could decide the
                  fate of the whole world and I wouldn't want that. He wouldn't
                  have deserved that gratification in the slightest.
                </span>
