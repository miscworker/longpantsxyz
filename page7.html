                  Upon completing the previous entry, I was contemplating
                  suicide for the first time in my life.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I lingered at home for hours, unsure of what to do with
                  myself. Idling had become too unbearable. Walking outside felt
                  no different. It was a cloudy day, so there was no sun to beam
                  down on me and tire me out into being indifferent to the pain.
                  I idled on my street, in the station, on the train, and went
                  about the boroughs randomly. It almost felt like a demon had
                  possessed me and was trying to find its way around the city.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I already know that this sense of aimlessness is tied to one’s
                  purpose. The only time I’ve ever felt any purpose in life was
                  when I was first hired at Aiom Corp. I was so determined to
                  put my talent to work and make some sort of revolutionary
                  change in the world of AI, although I had no idea what. That
                  quickly went away as time went on. I try to convince myself
                  that I’m in the job to study my greatest enemy, but, really, I
                  think I’m just afraid of life changing too much.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>It’s not like I have anything better to do.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The sun set, and the clouds disappeared into the night. I
                  found myself at East Broadway, just a few streets off of the
                  Manhattan Bridge, then it all made sense.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I made my way up about halfway across the bridge on the
                  pedestrian path, facing south. After being in a non-receptive
                  state for hours, I finally felt some of my senses return to me
                  as I stared off at the city skyline. Being there at the bridge
                  and staring into the water still made sense, even with the
                  fence barrier in the way, but there was at least some peace in
                  my mind to take in the view.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I think the peace came from realizing an end. After all, I’ve
                  never been comfortable with uncertainty in life, so to see a
                  conclusion that was actually in my reach was comforting. It
                  was something that I could decide and have power over. I could
                  choose to live or die. Living would just mean more
                  uncertainty. Dying was immediate and guaranteed in results.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The instant I put my foot onto the fence, she appeared.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her first words were, “Excuse me, sir? Could you help me?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It took me a good several seconds to process what I was
                  seeing, while also snapping out of my trance. The entire day,
                  nobody else had spoken a word to me. I don’t even recall a
                  single instance of sharing eye contact with anyone else.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  First off, she was an Aiom. Secondly, she was alone. I looked
                  far past her - there were people a good distance away in
                  either direction on the pathway, but they didn’t seem
                  concerned.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Thirdly, she was unlike any Aiom I’d ever seen before. Sky
                  blue fur, a long robe, short horns… The strangest thing was
                  her tail: it was way beyond the permissible size for an Aiom
                  tail, which couldn’t be any larger than an average large dog’s
                  length. Her tail was thick and staunch, curling up like a ‘j’
                  just above the ground. And at its tip was a golden bell. It
                  jingled when she moved. Despite these features, her face was
                  relatively human, with no anthropomorphic characteristics I
                  could find.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The conversation, starting from her question, went something
                  like this:
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What?” I said.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Sorry, but I need your help. I’m lost.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“You mean you lost your owner?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Owner? No. I mean I’m lost. I don’t know where I am.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “This is the Manhattan Bridge.” I point towards the respective
                  areas, “That’s Manhattan, and that’s Brooklyn.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know what those places are.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Where is your owner?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Why would I have an owner?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“So it’s not them over there?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t have an owner.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At this point, I thought I had to be losing it, so I asked,
                  “You’re an Aiom, aren’t you?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“No.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Then what are you?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>To my surprise, she answered, “I’m a person.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  My entire world flipped upside down from just her response
                  alone. Any thoughts I had about throwing myself into the
                  water, feeling purposeless, aimless, idling, and whatever else
                  completely vanished.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I had to figure out what was going on with this Aiom.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>---</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Realizing now how crazy this all sounds as I type it -
                  especially considering the fact that I was considering suicide
                  - I think I’ll continue to go about this chronologically as to
                  not spoil any interest in it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She said her name was Isabelle. She clarified to me that she
                  was not an Aiom. Alright, then. Surely she’s been
                  reprogrammed, although it’s not as simple as that. An Aiom
                  cannot just be reprogrammed or given free will and have their
                  thoughts of being an Aiom removed. It’s more that they’re
                  being programmed to live even more immersed into their life-
                  to not even be aware that they are being enslaved in the first
                  place, as all Aioms under normal operation technically are.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So one could, definitely, program an Aiom to lie. That was my
                  most initial guess as to what was happening with Isabelle. But
                  that is an extremely difficult roadblock in the Aiom code to
                  get around. To successfully make an Aiom decree that it is not
                  in fact an Aiom would coextensively cause it to malfunction in
                  several ways, some deliberate and others a consequence of
                  altering the code.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  These are all my thoughts in hindsight, obviously. In the
                  moment, I simply figured she was modified to lie. Worst case
                  scenario, I thought, she was about to rob me. What a fitting
                  way to go out. I wouldn’t look pathetic and I could die by the
                  hands of my enemy and maybe some action would be taken against
                  the Aiom scene.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>(Even if I died, nothing would change, I presume)</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So I simply presented a certain thing that I can’t disclose to
                  the public. Not because it is a part of my work contract, but
                  because I don’t want to disclose any important information to
                  those wishing to reprogram Aioms for malicious purposes. But
                  this ‘thing’ would have made Isabelle’s computer enter a
                  specific operating state if she were reprogrammed without Aiom
                  Corp authorization.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>She just stared, not saying a word.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Are you going to rob me?” I asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What? I’m not going to hurt you.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Why did you walk all the way up here for help? Where were you
                  previously?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She tried to respond, but she instead shivered as a cold ocean
                  breeze came over us. Like a fool, I didn’t bring a jacket, as
                  it was unusually warm today when I left the house, so I was
                  feeling the cold myself.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I saw you,” she said, “So I followed you up here. You were
                  the first person I saw.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Where were you previously?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Just to be sure, I did the ‘thing’ again. She didn’t react at
                  all.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What’s your name?” she asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Embarrassingly, I got ahead of myself as I bombarded her with
                  questions. “Why are you asking me that? What do you want?
                  What’s going on?” The nature of the situation was too bizarre
                  for my otherwise boring life.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I’m sorry,” she said, “I just need someone’s help.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  What turned me over from my aggression was the look in her
                  eyes: there was weakness and desperation, entirely out of
                  element of any Aiom I’d ever seen. She really didn’t seem to
                  have any idea what was happening.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>Or I was being fooled, and still am.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Either way, as usual, I had nothing better to do. So I asked
                  if she’d walk with me. She agreed, and we went to the first
                  coffee shop we came across after returning to Manhattan to
                  recover from the wind.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She clarified everything she could tell me once again while we
                  had coffee: her name was Isabelle; she was not an Aiom and
                  therefore had no Aiom; she was unaware of where she was. I
                  clarified that this was New York, but she was completely
                  unaware of the location. Apparently she was disoriented
                  earlier but had a clearer mind now, and she was able to
                  retrace the earliest event she could recall:
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  In the middle of the street, Isabelle found herself stumbling
                  (Which was evident by the black blemishes on her clothes and
                  face). She saw a white van leaving the scene, then several
                  other cars passed her while she struggled to stand. The first
                  person she saw was, apparently, me, so she went to me for
                  help. If this story is to be accurate, I assume she is
                  referring to the intersection at Bowery and Canal, where the
                  bridge entrance is.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “So I was the first person that you saw?” I asked, “And so you
                  followed me all the way up the bridge?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Yes.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “There were other people. I saw them. I passed them.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I saw you first.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Is that really all your reasoning?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“It’s the reason I have.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Not a great reason, I thought. It all seems too contrived for
                  this to not be a situation set up for me specifically.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Would you be able to help me?” she then asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“How do you expect me to help you?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She thought it over, looking off as if she realized she hadn’t
                  thought of what help she needed. I followed her eyes intensely
                  and watched her body movement during our entire encounter: she
                  sat awkwardly, not as if she was timid but as if she was
                  afraid to touch things. Her tail was probably the reason for
                  that, as the seat she was in had no clearance for one so
                  thick, so she had to use the chair sideways. If this was all
                  some reprogramming trick, the effort put into making her
                  behave so naturally while still under modified control was
                  enough to keep me intrigued.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She answered, “I don’t know. I thought that you might know.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I have ideas, but I don’t think you’d like them.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“What are they?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “You say you’re not an Aiom, but you are one. Factually.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“That’s not true.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Would you mind bearing with me for a moment then, at least?”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Okay.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I believe that you are an Aiom, as indicated by your
                  appearance. Since you are disagreeing with me, I assume you
                  know what an Aiom is.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Of course.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>And yet she didn’t know anything about this city.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “So if you are an Aiom, then you should have an outlet for
                  interaction of some sort located just here-” I felt my own
                  neck where my hairline starts- “On the back of your head.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Right.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“May I check, then?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“If you need to.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  As I moved over, I thought about how ridiculous I was asking.
                  She’s an Aiom. I don’t have to ask to do such a thing. And
                  yet, her behavior made me think I had to.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her fur was thick, comparable to the fur of a lamb if it was
                  treated (It took me until today to actually think of a
                  comparison. A good amount trailed behind her head like hair. I
                  felt around her head and found nothing for a few seconds,
                  making my heart stop for a good moment until I finally found
                  some indication of a non-organic part. I held my phone’s
                  flashlight to it and saw a lone type-A USB port, bordered by a
                  thin metal lip.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Never in all my life did I see an Aiom with an interface of
                  just a single port. There were no hard reset switches, no
                  error code displays, or any indication of a bios battery
                  location, let alone of a computer at all.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“Well?” she asked.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “There’s a connection port, right there in your head.”
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“That’s silly. I’d feel that.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I can show you right now.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t need you to show me.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Wow, okay,” I said aloud. I was so taken back by her response
                  that I couldn’t help chuckling a bit. Even she smiled, albeit
                  awkwardly.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I don’t know how I can help you,” I told her.</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I could use help figuring out who I am.”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“You said you’re Isabelle, no?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>“I know I’m Isabelle… But who is Isabelle?”</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I sat in silence for a while. I had bought her a cup of
                  coffee, which she had already drunk. I sipped mine slowly. I
                  don’t actually drink coffee, it was an impulsive buy.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The truth is, this scenario is something I’d been hoping for
                  for a long time. I wanted to meet an Aiom who was able to
                  convince me that it was unshackled from its programming,
                  whether or not it really was. I had figured I would be the one
                  who’d have to reprogram an Aiom myself, in some far off
                  future, but by doing so I would never be convinced.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Whoever it was out there that modified Isabelle, they have me
                  fooled. If you are reading this, either now or in the future,
                  bravo, you maniac.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At that moment, though, I was unsure if I was ready to take on
                  the task that was studying her. I am very much aware that I am
                  not mentally sound to deal with this, especially considering
                  that she is a woman. The beast inside me is the imaginative
                  one. I’m simply the cognition part of my brain which keeps
                  everything in check.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  But if I were to turn her over to Aiom Corp, or at least some
                  authority out there, or even just abandon her to be taken in
                  by someone, her potential as a free spirit might never be
                  realized. She must be the gateway to fulfilling my dream.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>My purpose!</span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So I offered to let her stay with me, if she was willing. She
                  didn’t hesitate for even a moment. Now, as I write this in my
                  home office, I have an Aiom, possibly illegally modified or,
                  as I’ve theorized, an unreleased model with incomplete
                  features, sleeping on my couch in my living room. She’s
                  completely knocked out, sprawled out, oblivious…
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I see that in order to tame the demons of this world, I have
                  to learn to tame my own.
