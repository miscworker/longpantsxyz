                  Before reading: I may have gone on longer than intended for
                  this post. Perhaps that’s fine, considering I am writing here
                  for therapeutic purposes, but do not be surprised if you find
                  yourself still scrolling a while later.

                  In light of my aggressive views on Aioms, I imagine that there
                  are, whether or not they contact me to say so, people who are
                  upset by my negative portrayal of them.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I should clarify that my criticisms or opinions aren’t
                  necessarily directed at people who own Aioms, at least not
                  towards the average consumer. It is directed at a capitalistic
                  economy that prioritizes profits and artificial happiness
                  before the health and well-being of humans. It is humanity at
                  fault, not the person - and yes, I mean humanity, not only the
                  few with the power to influence the world.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Those who are upset, including those who I have upsetted in
                  the past, usually criticize me for viewing the use of Aioms in
                  a largely sexual lens. Rationalize your ownership of an Aiom
                  however you want, but there is something undeniably perverted
                  in purchasing a lifeform bred for one’s pleasure, whether
                  sexual or not. We have come a long way to denounce slavery
                  along with all forms of discrimination, at least here in
                  America, and yet we are embracing the commodity of life all
                  over again because we suffer from mass amnesia. The phrase
                  ‘Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it’ is true
                  because the phrase itself is time-tested across humanity’s
                  existence.

                <br />
                <span>
                  Mass amnesia is a long topic that merits its own post here,
                  but, for the fairness of my critics, let’s talk about Aioms
                  while ignoring the perverted nature of them or the fact that
                  we have built a slave industry.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Aioms are advertised, first and foremost, as personal
                  companions. I am aware of how this is life changing for many
                  folks; it mirrors the controversies surrounding the increasing
                  use in AI chatbots and digital partners from several years
                  ago. It is easy to call anyone who uses those social
                  supplements a pathetic failure, but there are folks who are
                  doomed to never find a natural way to satisfy themselves in
                  the real world. The handicapped and mentally challenged are at
                  the forefront of these folks. It is not fair to expect someone
                  with a muscle-eating disease or severe social problems to be
                  able to find a partner as easily as the next person. It is not
                  even fair to expect any normal person to always be able to
                  find someone so easily. It was never easy for even myself, and
                  to this day it still is not.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Truthfully, some people are also just pathetic failures due to
                  a million coincidences, doomed to never find love or even good
                  friends. But this is not just a symptom exclusive to them -
                  this is a symptom derived from the environment we’ve created
                  for ourselves.

                  The environment for seeking connections has evolved
                  drastically since the beginning of the 20th century. In the
                  20th century, troubled romantics took out small section ads in
                  the newspaper crying for a lover of desirable type and look.
                  People could respond by sending a letter or even meeting them
                  at a particular location at a set time listed in the ad. In
                  the 1980s, video dating emerged, a format where subscribers
                  recorded video tapes of themselves to put together a profile,
                  sent their information and recording to a company, then the
                  company distributed these profiles to other subscribers deemed
                  a potential match.

                <span>
                  The 1990s and onward established internet dating, an era most
                  of us are probably familiar with, although the presentation of
                  dating sites and chat rooms has been massively different in
                  each decade since then. The ability to communicate
                  instantaneously with a potential match through email or
                  otherwise outclassed all other forms of dating. So much so
                  that this has become the cultural norm for most of America.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The similarities in each of these formats is that it implies
                  that the people using them have failed socially in their
                  current environment. Otherwise, why would they resort to using
                  such an inauthentic way of meeting new people?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This is reasonable to see occur in small amounts. Eccentric
                  people exist, as well as physically or mentally challenged
                  people. Again, even people exhibiting normal behavior and
                  physical traits can just so happen to suffer from the
                  challenge that is making friends, let alone finding lovers.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So what does it mean when the average American socially fails
                  in their environment?
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It means that our environment is consistently acting against
                  our social needs as humans.

                  The sameness which has encroached across New York City and its
                  streets and architecture has been several decades in the
                  making in the rest of the United States and Canada. All one
                  has to do to verify this is to look at what a majority of
                  American media depicts: roads, cars, and suburban cities. The
                  average American lives over a mile away to the nearest grocery
                  story. The average American commutes to work by car. The
                  average American is burdened with car payments, increasing
                  fuel prices, high insurance costs, inevitable maintenance
                  fees, and the constant danger of sharing the road with maniacs
                  somehow licensed to drive two ton vehicles.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  (Of course, a lot of American media also depicts our major
                  cities and their massively different lifestyles, but these are
                  often less associated with being ‘familiar social
                  fulfillments’ that say a typical sitcom of a suburban family
                  slots into. Instead they are often associated with either the
                  outlandish nature or events that come from living in a major
                  city - New York, L.A., and the Bay Area come to mind - or how
                  alien or crime-ridden these places are. I am willing to
                  concede from this argument as being biased towards what I have
                  been exposed to, but there is still truth in certain elements
                  being overexposed compared to others in media. Perhaps not a
                  fair point regardless.)

                  I can dance around the exhausting facts of automobile centric
                  society all day, but the cataclysmic effect of such a society
                  that (also) goes ignored is the social isolation we have all
                  accepted as being normal. The requirements for simply being
                  around others besides our immediate household, school peers,
                  or work peers is so ridiculous when compared to the
                  traditional development pattern of long ago that we invest
                  most of our life with inauthentic means of fulfilling our
                  social needs.

                  I remember visiting my grandmother who eventually settled in
                  Suntown with us, in her own home a bit of ways across town.
                  Due to her blindness, she was unable to drive, so she either
                  had to have one of my parents come to take her somewhere,
                  which would require driving all the way to her, or to call for
                  a cab. The inconvenience grew obvious and she felt ashamed in
                  asking for a lift so often, so she eventually stopped and
                  became a homebody.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Besides, there was little for her to do anyway, compared to
                  her last home in a small town in Florida. There, she had
                  various third places to go to: an informal park by the creek,
                  an active local diner, a classic drugstore that still had a
                  bar for shakes, a library, an outdoor theater, a spot to throw
                  horseshoes, an active church (She was not religious or of any
                  faith, but she enjoyed the community presence there). All of
                  these places in her town were privately owned by local
                  residents. I believe the only franchised or chain location was
                  a gas station at the edge of town.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Instead of spending the last eight years of her life among an
                  active community of residents familiar with one another, she
                  spent it watching detective shows and Hallmark movies on
                  repeat while playing 3-match games on her tablet. The closest
                  thing she had to a community was Facebook, where, based on
                  every experience I had on there, was only used for either
                  sharing memes, or complaining about politics or not being able
                  to park somewhere in town (Elderly folks with nothing better
                  to do aren’t exactly the most positive).
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Some folks might think that the issue was simply that she
                  could not drive, but that just avoids the problem of the
                  environment itself which we develop. Suburban sprawl provides
                  no culture or chances for authentic communities to come
                  together naturally or consistently. Even financially it is a
                  burden on the average American, barring many people from
                  opening businesses in places where it is completely
                  unsustainable due to low density, allowing only chain stores
                  and restaurants to set up in enormous big box stores only to
                  inevitably abandon them after at least a decade later (Which
                  then leaves an oversized building useless to every
                  establishment that does not use these big box stores, still
                  barring private business owners).

                  Now imagine this cultural death affecting our youth, yearning
                  for love and excitement. The only practical and accessible
                  means for young Americans would be social media, including
                  dating apps, a modern obsession. It comes as no surprise that
                  a boring environment produces teenage mischief and uninspired
                  people who grow out of their ambitions and fall into
                  unproductive lifestyles, such as normalized day-to-day gaming,
                  pornography addiction, vaping and smoking (or anything with
                  nicotine or THC), unhealthy eating habits. All of which
                  contributes to a sedentary lifestyle.

                  It should be noted that, purely in the context of North
                  America culture, suburbs are not the prime cause of these
                  issues. It is simply any environment where community is
                  discouraged due to the infrastructure involved, the sameness
                  which has encroached upon the area, or because of external
                  issues such as a failing economy or major events which causes
                  a shift in behavior (In a healthy community or environment,
                  residents should be able to properly react and rectify the
                  consequences of these events).

                  Sameness and discouraged engagement in a community will always
                  diminish the full social potential of a person. Only the most
                  eccentric or socially oblivious will be able to shine in these
                  habitats, and often they are pushed away or are forced to find
                  their own people, further separating the leaders from the
                  meek. Such effects bring on a failing community of unambitious
                  folks incapable of adapting to change and those whose
                  practices will bring down the community further.

                  … In all this, I may have lost sight of my point and not
                  realized how much I rambled here. What all this points to,
                  though, is that Aioms are yet another example of solving a
                  human-made problem of lack of social fulfillment. One does not
                  have to be prude or hateful of humanity’s sexual desires to
                  acknowledge this. In fact, embracing human love and sex should
                  be coextensive with denouncing the use of Aioms and all
                  related fulfilling technologies and practices.

                  For, when we make a world where it is impossible to be
                  authentically happy, we can only achieve inauthentic happiness
                  through artificial means.
