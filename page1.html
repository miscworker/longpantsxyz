                  I realize, from writing on here, that, whenever I finish and
                  upload the post, I have little else to do, especially on a
                  Sunday. Not that venting into a void is necessarily the sort
                  of therapy I was looking for, but it does interest me to see
                  my thoughts otherwise unsaid be written in a format for myself
                  and others to return to.
                </span>

                <br />
                <span>
                  I dread Sundays for contradictory reasons: returning to work
                  feels like a drag, but I have nothing to make use of my time
                  anymore, so I end up slogging around the house or outside. The
                  idea of doing nothing never made much sense to me, but I envy
                  those who find peace in it. On the other hand, going into work
                  means facing the forefront of the reality I despise so much.
                </span>

                <br />
                <span>
                  I realize now that it’s probably confusing that I work at Aiom
                  Corp while despising Aioms. I swear that there is a good
                  reason for it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  There is a lot to clarify in my relationship with Aioms. I do
                  not hate Aioms themselves. It is not their fault that they are
                  created from a laboratory only to be fitted with a
                  microcomputer and have their lives stolen. What I hate,
                  rather, is what they thus represent due to their existence:
                  the oblivious consumer world which will produce and justify
                  just about anything as long as it sells. This is obnoxious
                  enough with products such as vapes and junk foods, which are
                  designed to be addictive, but the fact that Aiom Corp openly
                  advertises a companion which can replace all relationships you
                  will ever need, and even friendships for those socially
                  deprived on an ultra level, is utterly dystopian. We have
                  entered the state of computer technology in which it replaces
                  aspects of human interaction on a level obvious to the average
                  (ignorant) person.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At one point though, I was unaware of all this. I thought
                  Aioms existed in the same way all innovations seem to exist in
                  the perspective of an ignorant person: because ‘why not?’
                  Since I was young, I have been entranced by the inner workings
                  of artificial intelligence in human interaction (AI in work
                  such as statistics, data collection, content generation, etc.
                  don’t intrigue me so much). I went to college up to my
                  master’s in AI computer programming and engineering with the
                  dream of working at Aiom Corp, and it all actually worked out
                  as well as it could. They were seeking freshly graduated
                  recruits at the time and selected me to enlist in their
                  academy.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Yes, Aiom Corp has its own academy for considering what you
                  should even do in their company. Like the rest of school, I
                  finished at the top of their three month course, and my
                  superiors had me fly out here to New York to work in their
                  office in person. It all couldn’t have been more convenient -
                  I was able to escape the suburban, culture-eating hellhole
                  that was my home, move to an amazing city, plant myself
                  immediately in the company I wanted to work in, and all while
                  affording to do so. Hell, Aiom Corp had even bought the Empire
                  State Building years prior, and that’s my favorite building in
                  this entire city (They take heavy precautions in keeping all
                  their work secret and secure. Remote work is not an option if
                  you handle Aiom source code in any shape or form. If there is
                  a blizzard, my office just closes entirely.)

                <span>
                  There was virtually not a single issue in the world with my
                  life changing as it did ten years ago. I suppose my father
                  being disappointed was one of them, but I stopped caring about
                  his opinion in my late teens. My mother supported me as long
                  as I was happy.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I don’t know when it was that I realized that Aioms were not
                  good for America. I was aware of their creation process and
                  whatnot for a while, long before ever working at Aiom Corp. It
                  is all public information, although Aiom Corp never refers to
                  the process in ways that might allude to technological slavery
                  or anything reminiscent of a dystopian novel (Even the acronym
                  for ‘Aiom’, which is ‘Artificially Intelligent Organic
                  Machine,’ is omitted from everything in public media except
                  for disclaimers and technical documentation).
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I do recall a disturbing news story from about seven years ago
                  that stuck with me ever since I heard about it. A man, forty
                  years old at the time, purchased an Aiom three years before
                  the story and had her taken to an off-market modifier to
                  discreetly tamper with the pain network circuitry in her
                  microcomputer.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Aiom lesson for context: The pain network circuitry intercepts
                  signals from the nervous system in an Aiom which would
                  otherwise go to the appropriate parts of the brain (It is
                  several locations, where exactly I forget) and signal pain.
                  The interception does not make them unable to detect pain, but
                  rather it nullifies their intense reactions unless it is a
                  severe enough injury. It also intercepts them in order to
                  catalog possible abuse they receive from their owner, which is
                  then shared with the Online Aiom Network, which tracks their
                  wellbeing and if any measures have to be taken. So if an Aiom
                  were to stub its toe (Which would be an indication of a
                  movement or tracking malfunction considering they are
                  electronically assisted), it wouldn’t overreact the same way a
                  regular person would but it would still be aware of it. If it
                  had its arm severed, it would make a fuss but just to bring
                  awareness to its injury. If it were being deliberately
                  attacked, it would defend itself and the OA Network would be
                  notified.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  It can be imagined what sort of intent someone who wishes to
                  discreetly disable an Aiom’s connection with the OA network in
                  regards to its pain would have. I believe he was reported by a
                  resident in the same building as seeing him throwing out
                  something bloody in the early morning hours. When authorities
                  entered his apartment, they found the Aiom woman - a feline
                  furry model, apparently in the same pattern of a childhood cat
                  he had, chained to a wall with not only her microcomputer
                  tampered with as I described, but as well as her ability to
                  speak entirely. Her pawed feet were severed and located in the
                  garbage he threw away hours before; her body was littered with
                  deep cuts and lacerations, many damaged from applied liquids.
                  She was equipped with an IV attached to a gallon of
                  company-grade Aiom nutrition fluid to feed her as her body
                  struggled to regenerate itself. Considering the genetically
                  enhanced speed at which Aioms are able to recover at least
                  cuts and bruises, the fact that she was covered with so many
                  still meant that they could have been made only within the
                  hour upon discovering her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The Aiom was registered as a romantic companion, unnamed.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  After that story came out, there was quite a bit of
                  controversy around Aiom Corp, though obviously not the first
                  to come around. My office floor, who were all fellow Aiom
                  personality programmers, were briefed on figuring out
                  alternative methods to allow Aioms to recognize when they are
                  in danger or if they are witnessing criminal behavior.
                  Honestly, I was surprised that this had not been addressed
                  sooner. If one of the main concerns of Aioms is the safety of
                  humans, I can only imagine what ones that have been illegally
                  modified are behaving like out of public view.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  One can probably imagine the difficulty of programming a
                  guarantee of separation in understanding danger and
                  make-believe (A very, very large number of Aiom owners
                  purchase the product for BDSM purposes). A recent method in
                  training Aiom AI is to not actually train their programming
                  itself, but to train the already intelligent brains they have
                  through actual classes before they are rolled out to
                  consumers. It is a bizarre scene to witness: Aioms of
                  different genders, sizes, cross-species sitting at desks and
                  watching videos and listening to an instructor on recognizing
                  danger versus bedroom fun. The efforts do help, but it is much
                  more cost-efficient for a genius or two to figure out the
                  right algorithms and few lines of code to teach the necessary
                  knowledge to all Aioms through simple patch and an hour or two
                  of coma-induced AI training. If you are not an Aiom owner and
                  you’ve ever wondered why one day there suddenly aren’t as many
                  scantily-dressed women or unusual looking people outside, it’s
                  likely because an Aiom software patch was rolled out and they
                  are all at home sleeping while their computer plays subliminal
                  messages into their brain to finalize their update.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  That story always stuck with me like a thorn, though. I knew
                  people could absolutely use Aioms for bad, just like any other
                  piece of technology. But at the same time, they are alive, and
                  demented people realize that themselves and all the things
                  they could do with that information. I consider myself one of
                  those demented people, but for reasons which aren’t widely
                  agreed with.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I don’t believe that story triggered any sort of epiphany for
                  me about Aioms. The awareness was gradual until it was one day
                  realized at no particular moment - probably five years ago I
                  can say I was fully aware. However, leaving my job would have
                  and still be a huge issue for me. If I give up my job and my
                  salary, I would definitely have to move out of my current home
                  in Astoria, the third floor in a beautiful brownstone I refuse
                  to abandon. I would have to leave the city, and, as much as I
                  hate everything happening and the constant day-to-day exposure
                  of Aioms, I can’t do that. I’m not prepared yet, anyway.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Not only that, but it is my responsibility to understand the
                  dystopia encroaching upon the world. If I never joined Aiom
                  Corp, I never would have received the wealth of knowledge on
                  artificial intelligence that I have now. I at least am able to
                  ensure that Aioms are safe for people if they must be used,
                  not that I’d ever consider myself or anyone else a hero for
                  that.

                  But if I am to ever be a hero and save America, I will need
                  first-hand experience with the enemy.

                  … There is also the fact that, again, I do enjoy working with
                  artificial intelligence.

                  I just did not plan on employing my abilities in designing the
                  behavior of an average sex-addicted anthropomorphic character
                  turned to life.
