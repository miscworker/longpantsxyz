                  I am exhausted, but I don’t want to go to sleep without
                  writing about my experiences today.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Isabelle is definitely an unusual specimen. I say that from
                  the perspective of a researcher. If she is really a person,
                  well, I’ll come to regret calling her that, I’m sure.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I wasn’t able to sleep for all of Sunday morning. Isabelle
                  awoke at around nine. In the sunlight, the mess my apartment
                  was in was apparent enough for her to comment about it. She
                  phrased it in such a way where it couldn’t be confirmed as a
                  complaint - “Goodness, I hope nothing bad happened here.” I
                  couldn’t blame her. I’ve had a hard time keeping my place
                  clean for the past while. I guess no amount of personal
                  struggles can excuse letting takeout containers stack up
                  around the trash can though.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The first thing I wanted to do was plug a computer into her
                  lone USB port - save the sexual innuendos, please - but she
                  insisted that she wanted to eat first. She pushed back against
                  my plan until I finally budged, and I went out to the nearest
                  deli for a couple of breakfast platters. Before I left, I
                  asked her to promise me that she wouldn’t leave the apartment,
                  to which she had no problem.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So, first and foremost: Isabelle already shows more resistance
                  than any Aiom should. While she already shows signs of
                  submission, considering she was willing to sleep on my own
                  couch without a second thought, the fact that she prioritized
                  her own needs before my own wishes proves some sense of self
                  beyond her relationship to another. Usually an Aiom would at
                  worst warn the owner that they require substance, but never
                  would they interfere with their owner’s plans.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  When I returned home, she was cleaning up the place, throwing
                  trash away into a garbage bag. When I asked why she felt the
                  need to clean up, she said it was the least she could do if I
                  am going to help her - moreso, she admitted, was that the
                  place was too cluttered for her liking.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “Do you feel like you have the authority to do what you want
                  here?” I asked her. I wasn’t offended, but rather curious as
                  to how she'd react.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  “I think anyone should be allowed to clean up a mess,” she
                  said something of the sort.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  She ate her breakfast quickly but politely, then finally she
                  let me connect my laptop into her USB port (I absolutely have
                  no idea how else to phrase this without it sounding a certain
                  way). She insisted that the cord was inserting into nothing
                  even as I did it.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  So there is in fact something in her head to be found,
                  according to the Aiom troubleshooter: a microcomputer of
                  standard design for an Aiom from eleven years ago. Not a
                  single transferable file in its two gigabytes of storage.
                  There was no existent operating system on it, and the bios,
                  which would’ve contained the base Aiom AI that most models
                  have, was locked behind what could’ve been a few dozen layers
                  of encryption, a huge red flag for criminal use. As for the
                  purpose of this Aiom being modified, I’ll get to that at the
                  end of this.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The computer model being eleven years old isn’t a signifier of
                  Isabelle’s age. When I asked her age, she said she didn’t
                  know. I’d place her apparent age as thirty-five. The
                  incomplete, simplified computer does imply that she could be
                  an unauthorized production model, or perhaps an Aiom used for
                  testing and to never be released for public use.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  (Aioms in these scenarios aren’t killed or discarded, of
                  course. They are just repurposed for simple tasks, such as
                  cleaning, within Aiom Corp or other locations. That still does
                  not make up for how depressing of an existence they are cursed
                  with.)
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  If Isabelle is, in fact, either a beta model or unauthorized
                  model, that could also mean that she didn’t contain any actual
                  tracking functions. I don’t have any means of verifying if she
                  is receiving a signal from anywhere, but I’ll try and find out
                  sooner or later.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  That deadend left me with her actual appearance to evaluate,
                  something I wasn’t too keen on doing. I’m not about to remove
                  her robe and see what she looked like under there - whether or
                  not she was an Aiom, nor if I was genuinely just trying to
                  research her, it isn’t my business at all. Instead I focused
                  on just what I saw and what I asked of her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her non-human features are typical for an anthro Aiom,
                  although I’m not sure if referring to her as an anthro is
                  fair. Her facial traits are all human: no fangs, no snout, no
                  predatory eyes, etc. I’m not good at describing human faces,
                  but I would call hers soft at heart but somehow roughened. I
                  might be focusing too much on the gaze in her eyes as she
                  followed mine, a captivating feature of hers.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The horns are standard: small curled bits at either side of
                  her head, rooting from her skull like ornaments rather than
                  anything similar to a real animal. They are a faded beige,
                  barely shiny at all. A good wax and shine would probably bring
                  out their glamor once more.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her hands are normal human hands, lined with a thin fur coat
                  versus the slightly thicker amount along the rest of her
                  visible body (Visible body that I’ve examined being her arms,
                  ankles, feet, and neck and up). On her palms where the fur
                  receded, her skin loses pigment as normal.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Her feet are the general shape of a human’s, but she bears
                  paws at the end of her feet instead of toes. Strangely, she is
                  also very flat footed; I asked if it hurt her to walk here,
                  which she did barefoot, and she said she didn’t mind it. At
                  that point I realized I needed to have her shower as soon as
                  possible.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The tail is probably her most interesting feature. For one,
                  it’s oversized, both in length and thickness. I don’t know how
                  she is able to withstand it, but it looks like there is a
                  balance between it and her larger size(Compared to people, she
                  is larger, but there are plenty of six foot plus Aioms
                  around). It doesn’t wag or seem to emote, but it does slump
                  when she’s in a relaxed sitting position, and it curls up
                  enough to not touch the floor. Consequently, due to its size,
                  I haven’t seen her sleep on her back yet.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  None of that compares in weirdness to the bell at the end of
                  the tail: a sleigh bell, a faded beige in color similar to her
                  horns, which rang as often as she moved. It was one of the
                  reasons I couldn’t sleep all night. I just laid on my back,
                  staring at the ceiling and anticipating every next movement of
                  hers.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  The bell is not organic. It was attached to her tail after she
                  was created. I asked her about it, and she acted like it was a
                  normal thing to have stuck to her. It’s considerably large and
                  detailed with patterns. Perhaps I can trace its make to
                  somewhere, assuming it was not made exclusively for her.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Lastly, her robe. A simple, beige overthrow. It’s nothing
                  remarkable, but its mundane nature separates her from other
                  anthro Aioms, who are normally needlessly extravagant in their
                  outfits. Her robe is quite dirty still, blemished from when
                  she supposedly rolled over in the street. She’s showered
                  already and is wearing an old pair of pajamas of mine while
                  she sleeps on the couch. I didn’t catch too much of a look,
                  for my own sake, but her tail makes it awkward for her to
                  wear.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  That is all the info I have for now. I don’t know what to make
                  of her just yet, but the sane part of me is still spooked by
                  the dangerously curious part which brought her into my own
                  home. I don’t think she’s being controlled or tracked at all,
                  but to just have another woman here…
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  During the day while I inspected her, she continued to clean
                  up the place as needed. I thought that it might have been some
                  part of the Aiom AI insisting that she cleaned up and provided
                  a service to me, but I think now that she probably just felt
                  like she owed me for providing her a place. I’d prefer if that
                  were the case, but, at the same time, I’d rather not. I
                  believe she’s too trusting and casual for someone in her
